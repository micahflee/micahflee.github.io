      <p>I don't know why questions and concerns about the funding of a project are automatically handwaved considering how malevolent the US DoD and espionage cabals are. "Who cares if animals were vivisected, it's good medicine right? Who cares if chickens suffered in squalor, you like eggs don't you? Who cares if US intelligence routinely overthrows democratic governments and kills and tortures people, Tor works doesn't it?" 
Tor's government sponsors and the people they pay contract dollars to both have a PR responsibility to promote the use of Tor as an instrument of freedom for journalists and activists in oppressive countries. Imagine how ironic that is: use this tool, funded by the same outfit that funded the death squads who murdered and tortured their way into power, to protect yourselves from them. Would people be jumping at that chance? Would they if Tor was started by the Stasi or Russia, even if it was technically sound? I highly doubt it. (But the website discloses these facts, so it must be true that everyone using Tor is aware of it, sure. Let's get extremely mad at the article which is 90% comprised of this totally mundane information.) So then, all you'd have left is spooks and criminals and society may decide it's not such a positive thing after all, which may compromise either the funds or tolerance of its anarchic element. And it's possible that Tor developers have little on their minds but getting paid to work on math problems without paying attention to the ethical quandaries of their benefactors. And also possible that the actions of Tor's benefactors weigh less on the minds of its supporters than unkind 140 character Tweets.
 Yes, even cancer charities return donations to people who merely say hateful things in public. A lot of NGOs working to make the world better would never take DoD funding, not that they couldn't put the money to good use, because it raises serious questions about their integrity and their credibility and reputation. That suspicion is all that's necessary! Not here, for some reason. But if next year Human Rights Watch decided to take 90% of their funding from the CIA, and even if they both asserted it had no effect on their work and no evidence could be found that it did, do you really think the world would be fine with it? People have every reason to doubt Tor or refuse to use it from an ethical position, I don't see why it should be held to a different standard from other non-profits and such that promote themselves as being for the public good. I'd like to see reporting into how much of a connection there is between its biggest proponents and beneficiaries and various American prismatic democracy-spreaders.</p>

      <p>Concerns about funding are 100% valid. I pointed that out in this blog post.</p>
<p>However spreading unfounded lies about the safety of a tool that people rely on to protect themselves is irresponsible and simply bad for the world.</p>
<blockquote>How is it possible that a privacy tool was created by the same military and intelligence agencies that it’s supposed to guard us against? Is it a ruse? A sham? A honeytrap? Maybe I’m just being too paranoid... Unfortunately, this is not a tinfoil hat conspiracy theory. It is cold hard fact.</blockquote><p>If you're going to make damning accusations like this, you need to back it up with facts.</p>

      <p>These are some of the valid points I think the article raises:</p>
<p>'But the German <a href="http://daserste.ndr.de/panorama/aktuell/nsa230_page-1.html" rel="nofollow">exposé</a>  showed Tor providing the opposite of anonymity: it singled out users for total NSA surveillance, potentially sucking up and recording everything they did online.'</p>
<p>'In 2013, the Washington Post <a href="https://www.evernote.com/shard/s1/sh/fe14ebf3-7be6-42a8-9960-edae3e49644a/7efa13a46c7e032fdb8505eb63c34458" rel="nofollow">revealed</a> that the NSA had figured out various ways of unmasking and penetrating the anonymity of the Tor Network.'</p>
<p>'In a 2011 discussion on Tor’s official listserv, Tor developer Mike Perry admitted that Tor might not be very effective against powerful, organized “adversaries” (aka governments) that are capable monitoring huge swaths of the Internet.'</p>
<p>'some aspects about Tor are definitely welcomed by the NSA, in part because it helps concentrate potential “targets” in one convenient location.'</p>
<p>Basically - using Tor can highlight you for more intensive NSA surveillance, and its reasonably likely you can be de-anonymized by them.</p>
<p>For people who knew the story of Tor well a lot of Yasha's piece might have seemed conspiratorial.. But there are a lot of people out there who have the perception of Tor as a tool for anonymity on the net made by anti-surveillance groups..</p>
<p>And there is some irony that key members of the anti surveillance crew are on the payroll with the same spooks they are fighting.</p>
<p>Writing about Tor's funding and history doesn't equate to calling Tor a conspiracy.</p>
