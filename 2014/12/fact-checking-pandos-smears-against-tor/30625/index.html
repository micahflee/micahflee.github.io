      <p>This is a well written rebuttal to Yasha's reporting except for all of the name calling. I'm just a curious bystander who  and would like to see Tor get adopted more widely, but this whole kerfuffle is starting to worry me.</p>
<p>The facts about the DoD funding were not clear until Pando made them clear. I had been following Tor for a while before I read the Pando piece. Your own thoughts about weaning Tor away from the DoD are really great to hear. The explanation of exit-nodes, etc. is also really great. These are the kinds of conversations Tor-users will benefit from and this seems entirely due to an outsider critically looking at the project.</p>
<p>It would be really helpful to move past the binary rhetoric. I feel like a big part of this whole stink comes from the huge gap in understanding over crypto and open source software-dev in general. The DoD funding bothers me less now that it's out in the open and we're talking about it. Quinn did a really good job of pointing out that Tor needs to do a better job explaining itself, if it ever wants the wide adoption it's aiming for.</p>
<p>I read Pando regularly (I've been a fan of the NSFW News Corp crew for a couple of years) and I am also a fan of Tor and the EFF. They are not mutually exclusive worlds (although I see the apparent tension).</p>
<p>Micah, you're clearly intelligent and informed and are in a position to speak to the Tor side — help the Tor community push past the reactionary stance and use the reporting to improve it's stance. Trying to make this conversation be about harassment/trolling is really diluting the counterpoint of what you're saying.</p>
<p>Being a Tor developer/advocate is not an easy job. Being an independent journalist is not easy job. For the most part everyone involved is doing good work and this intersection via criticism should bring about dialog, not shouting matches.</p>
<p>Yeah, the jjabroni10-dude was obnoxious and sexist and his presence has been really shitty for the whole discussion. GG consists of thousands of coordinated accounts but according to Shepared's research jabroni had like 7–10? The whole doxxing him off the internet ordeal is a deliciously-ironic and highly-depressing twist. It was a politically stupid, slightly hypocritical move for anonymity advocates to use technological prowess to squash an isolated gadfly.</p>
<p>If there needs to be a public hero in this whole controversy it's probably going to be Pando if things continue the way they are. Tor gains nothing by crying foul against well researched, easy to understand reporting.</p>

      <blockquote>If there needs to be a public hero in this whole controversy it’s probably going to be Pando if things continue the way they are. Tor gains nothing by crying foul against well researched, easy to understand reporting.</blockquote><p>I'm entirely confused by this. Are saying that that Pando's article that deliberately spreading lies about an important software project that people rely on to stay is "well researched"?</p>
<p>Lies such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Is it a ruse? A sham? A honeytrap? Maybe I’m just being too paranoid… Unfortunately, this is not a tinfoil hat conspiracy theory. It is cold hard fact." </li>
<li>"Tor's current purpose is to cloak the online identity of government agents and informants while they are in the field"</li>
</ul>
<p>The Pando people remind me of anti-vaccine conspiracy theorists. Despite what the vast body of research into Tor shows, they insist that it's a honeytrap and not safe to use. This is irresponsible, and it will never make them a "hero".</p>

      <p>Thanks for responding — re. your two points.</p>
<p>Point 1, the full quote is:</p>
<p>"NSA? DoD? U.S. Navy? Police surveillance? What the hell is going on? How is it possible that a privacy tool was created by the same military and intelligence agencies that it’s supposed to guard us against? Is it a ruse? A sham? A honeytrap? Maybe I’m just being too paranoid…"</p>
<p>In this sentence he's not stating facts he's posing suppositions. Reasonable suppositions. It's clear Yasha does not trust the Tor project but he clearly ends that with "Maybe I'm just being too paranoid…" — it's transparently delineated as his feelings (not a list of facts). You can say his conclusion is more true, or more false... but it's not a lie.</p>
<ul>
<li>“Tor’s current purpose is to cloak the online identity of government agents and informants while they are in the field”</li>
</ul>
<p>Right, it's a tough statement and potentially it's one of the most inflammatory parts of the piece but I don't think it's a smear — it's a plausible conclusion given the research (again, he's not a liar, he's just working from a misconception). The onus of proving it <strong>wrong</strong> is important and worthwhile. In this instance your counterpoint (this blog post) is hugely valuable.</p>
<p>I do think that Tor (which I agree is a valuable tool) deserves a hard look, and Yasha specializes in taking hard looks. Obviously a project developed in the open and made freely available will have a multitude of uses — but the people who give it  the most money have a particular set of uses in mind. Maybe the government funds going into Tor readily acknowledge the value of these other use cases. It's worth talking about even if it's fuzzy for an anonymity network to prove how it's used.</p>
<p>It's an interesting issue of OpenSource software is that it needs donors and patrons to stay viable but there is always a tension between project sponsors and the primary developers. Just look at Joyent and the node/io.js forking. I'm not questioning the motives of any of the Tor devs, they have a tough job and I respect their work, but it's reasonable to wonder how government funding influences the project even if it's insignificant (which is an open question we have to have answered).</p>

      <p>The <i>full</i> full quote is:</p>
<blockquote>

Unfortunately, this is not a tinfoil hat conspiracy theory. It is cold hard fact.
</blockquote><p>So when Yasha says that this is not a tinfoil hat conspiracy theory and that it is "cold hard fact", what is he referring to? The only fact that Yasha references in his whole post is where Tor gets its funding. However what I quoted above certainly makes it seem like Tor being a honeytrap is "cold hard fact".</p>
<p>And regarding the purpose of Tor quote, it's not backed up by anything. The purpose of Tor is to solve a shared problem that many different communities have. Like I just posted in a different comment: The actual purpose of Tor is to create an open and secure onion routing network, so that anyone can make anonymous TCP connections on the internet without having to trust the individual nodes in the network.</p>
<p>Focusing on one of the countless ways that Tor can be used and saying that that's "the purpose of Tor" is deliberately misleading.</p>

      <p>No dog in this fight except the privacy we all deserve. If you believe for one second that the same government that gave all of it's allies the well cracked Enigma machine as unbreakable encryption has handed an International anonymous communications tool to the world for free, you are ignorant of history and how our government operates.  Don't get me wrong, they make mistakes, but they don't fund those mistakes for 10 years.</p>
<p>Now, I don't have any proof, but you can't prove that the US government doesn't own the entire onion from end to end. However, my opinion (that TOR is not secure) has the advantage of remaining within historical context of previous operations of our government, while your opinion (TOR is secure) is simply wishful thinking based on misplaced trust. No one needs vague conspiracy theories when the track record is so clear. If TOR was not initially founded as a rehash of the Enigma machine, it certainly didn't remain well funded for a decade without being bent in that direction.</p>
<p>This isn't about me, or you, just historical records versus guessing and history has something to teach us regarding TOR, while guessing has no value at all.</p>

      <p>Oh well if we're using that logic then the purpose of Tor is so that people like you and your family use Tor to protect themselves, their children, and their dignity while using the Internet. Why didn't Pando mention that?</p>
<p>The "Who uses Tor?" section is a list of different types of people who use Tor, not the purpose of Tor.</p>

      <p>"Tor’s current purpose" implies there is ONE purpose.</p>
<p>"it’s on the screenshot" among others, so it cannot be THE purpose.</p>

      <p>"anti-vaccine conspiracy theorists" have crazy theories but they also have VERY good points about vaccines being untested, sometimes inefficient, sometimes dangerous, very often useless medical treatments (esp. the ineffective, or inefficient, "flu" vaccine).</p>
