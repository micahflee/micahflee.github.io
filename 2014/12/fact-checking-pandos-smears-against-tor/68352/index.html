      <p>Levine should be distrusted simply because his selfie on that site has a pyramid in the background...</p>
<p>Recently, several new nodes appeared in Tor: niftygerbil, niftymouse, niftysquirrel, etc., coincidentally with names straight out of the NSA linguists playbook, which I imagine could produce some interesting research.</p>
<p>But so many Tor cheerleaders have been so quick to pronounce it safe that they themselves seem to betray basic creative questioning, or outside the box scientific skepticism.</p>
<p>From my experience, the MIM attacks against Tor have been common place in the U.S. since at least 2008, and LEO's then were primarily engaged in figuring out how it works, and deliberately NOT bringing cases, because of the fact that this would reveal the larger apparatus that Snowden gave us.</p>
<p>Between 2008-2013, they were "targeting individuals," as study subjects, in a grand nation-wide double bind study/experiments-like Bateson's porpoises, but with computers. So, on one hand, you have/had the DEA setting up drug deals from start to finish, and the FBI creating mentally ill 'terrorists," and "rings of pedophiles," and then following them around to see how they reacted to various provocations, while agents studied their communications and associations via Tor, and so on. Then they targeted these guys with exploits of all kinds-all 'off the records.'</p>
<p>I personally have observed Tor crash especially when using nodes that are routed directly through Booz Allen; and you yourself have covered how whole institutions have worked for the FBI et ass to study routing and endpoint map individual Tor users- but one less-than-disclosed fact is that Tor can be exploited by simply deploying a Teardrop attack against someone who has been previously pin-pointed and targeted, which causes browser dumps, and fills intel agency baskets with goodies.  This of course, after targets are identified and tracked over time and then parallel constructed (Ross Ulbricht was likely one such target-set 'em up, and knock 'em down...suuuure, some IRS investigator figured it all out....).</p>
<p>What is happening- and one would have to break the law, bend it or cause the appearance of breaking the law to demonstrate it (in a sandboxed machine of course), is that that the big FiveEyes agencies are essentially creating cases, and then kicking them down to LEO's across the world after they themselves have exploited targets for HUMINT. And Israel is itself highly engaged in 'anonymous tipsterism,' after they determine if someone if a zionist or not; then turning them over to our agencies. The USAF has some interesting offshore capabilities of exploitation as well.</p>
<p>Then, after a target has worn out their HUMINT capability, they agencies kick the case down to local LEO's  who act like the case came from the ISP, the post office (sure-old man Berman is rolling in his grave) or an 'anonymous tipster, or ICAC or NCMEC, or any of the 'human trafficking' agencies, and parallel construct a case or two, and get more federal funding cuz, pedophiles, terrorists, and journalism.</p>
<p>You are a brilliant tech- I bet you can replicate everything I say above and apply sound science to it. But it helps to remain skeptical, and find balance. Somewhere between conspiracy theory and empirical data lies conspiracy facts that can and should be put together so that qualified people can learn to ask the right questions, and those of us who discover these things should b lauded, not ostracized as crackpots.</p>
<p>We know Oswald was a patsy; that Tesla was ruined; that COINTELPRO was real and is today; and even Hillary was right about vast conspiracies- even as she touted the "Russian hacker" story. And, William Binney and Kurt Wiebe are now actively researching the phenomenon of "targeted individuals" who are victims of "organized stalking."</p>
<p>What  is much harder to discuss or disclose, is why even the best of journalists don't investigate FIRST, before we the people do the homework. Imagine how Snowden felt when he broke the law-but did the research anyways. Not all of us have the cash to get out of America while we can....</p>
