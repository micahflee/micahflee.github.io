      <p>I don't know if others use Twitter the same way that I do, but I tend to like things quite a bit more frequently than I tweet or retweet things. I'd imagine that if you analyzed my last 10 years of Twitter likes, you could learn much more about me than just by looking at my timeline. My likes probably reveal exactly which political, technical, and social arguments I followed, and which sides I took in all of them.</p>
<p>I recently programmed a tool called <a href="https://micahflee.com/2019/06/semiphemeral-automatically-delete-your-old-tweets-except-for-the-ones-you-want-to-keep/">semiphemeral</a>  to automate deleting all of my old tweets (except for ones that I want to keep), and it also goes back and unlikes all of the tweets that I liked more than 60 days ago  -- or, so I initially thought. It soon became clear that semiphemeral only actually deleted the most recent 4,000 likes.</p>

      <p>In the almost 10 years that I've been using Twitter, I tweeted about 13,700 times, retweeted about 9,000 tweets, and liked (or "favorited", as we called liking back in the day) about 14,000 tweets. I decided to delete most of them using a tool I just finished programming called <a href="https://github.com/micahflee/semiphemeral">semiphemeral</a>. Here is why, and how.</p>

      <p>After nearly a year of work from a <a href="https://github.com/micahflee/onionshare/wiki/Developing-OnionShare">growing community</a> of developers, designers, and translators, I'm excited that OnionShare 2 is finally ready. You can download it from <a href="https://onionshare.org/">onionshare.org</a>.</p>
<p>OnionShare is an open source tool for securely and anonymously sending and receiving files using Tor onion services. It works by starting a web server directly on your computer and making it accessible as an unguessable Tor web address that others can load in <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor Browser</a> to download files from you, or upload files to you. It doesn't require setting up a separate server, using a third party file-sharing service, or even logging into an account.</p>

      <p>Last weekend, WikiLeaks sent an email to journalists with a list of 140 things not to say about WikiLeaks and Julian Assange because they are "false and defamatory." Reuters first <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-ecuador-assange/wikileaks-tells-reporters-140-things-not-to-say-about-julian-assange-idUSKCN1P00NN">broke</a> the story, and the next day Emma Best <a href="https://emma.best/2019/01/07/140-things-youre-not-allowed-to-say-about-assange-or-wikileaks/">published</a> the complete list. Many of the things on the list can't actually be "false" because they're subjective or nuanced ("It is false and defamatory to suggest that Julian Assange is a 'hacker'"), and many aren't defamatory, even if they are false ("It is false and defamatory to suggest that Julian Assange’s profession is 'computer programmer'.").</p>
<p>And many of the the things on the list are <em>true</em>, and WikiLeaks/Assange are being misleading. Some directly relate to me -- they came from Twitter fights I've with WikiLeaks and its minions. So I thought I'd fact check WikiLeaks' "false and defamatory" censorship list. This is by no means an exhaustive fact check -- for example, I'm not not covering the list items about the two Swedish women who accused Assange of rape, though I'm pretty confident a lot of that stuff is misleading as well. Before digging into the misinformation, I first want to take a moment to discuss how pathetic this is.</p>

<p>Over the last 10 months volunteer developers, designers, translators, and I have been hard at work on OnionShare 2.0, and it’s nearly ready. If you’d like to chip in during the month or so before the final release, <strong>try out the <a href="https://github.com/micahflee/onionshare/releases/tag/v2.0.dev2">latest development version</a> and report any bugs</strong>. The best way to report bugs is by <a href="https://github.com/micahflee/onionshare/issues/new">opening an issue</a> on GitHub and describing the problem, or you can send me an email at micah@micahflee.com if you don’t have a GitHub account.</p>

      <p>It’s been some time since I’ve written about OnionShare, so I thought I’d write an update on all of the latest work. Today we released version 1.3 (and last month we released 1.2, so the releases are getting more frequent). You can get the latest version at onionshare.org.</p>
<p>But first, I owe a huge thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/_mig5">Miguel Jacq</a> for churning out new features, taking over a lot of the GitHub issue triaging responsibilities, and becoming a core OnionShare developer.</p>
<p>If you haven’t tried it out in awhile, here are some things that are new:</p>

      <p>I recently traveled to Amsterdam to attend a meeting with Tor Project staff, volunteers, and other members of the wider Tor community. Before trips like this, I prepare a separate travel computer, only bringing with me data and credentials that I might need during my trip. My primary laptop runs <a href="https://www.qubes-os.org/">Qubes</a>, but this time I decided to install <a href="https://subgraph.com/sgos/index.en.html">Subgraph OS</a> on my travel laptop. I had only briefly messed with it before, and there’s no better way to learn about a new operating system than by forcing yourself to actually use it for a few days.</p>
<p>Subgraph OS is an “adversary resistant computing platform.” It’s similar to <a href="https://tails.boum.org/">Tails</a> in that it’s based on Debian and all traffic is forced through Tor (that’s changing though: there’s now basic support for <a href="https://subgraph.com/sgos/documentation/clearnet-chromium/">clearnet Chromium</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/subgraph/status/846455144648785921">OpenVPN</a>). It uses a grsecurity Linux kernel, and many apps run in “oz sandboxes”, a homebrew sandbox solution that protects you even if an attacker manages to exploit a bug in one of these apps. Subgraph OS also includes the Subgraph Firewall, an application firewall similar to Little Snitch for macOS — something that’s pretty awesome, and hasn’t really existed in the Linux ecosystem before. Basically, it’s designed to be an easy-to-use Linux distro that’s extremely secure.</p>

      <p>Qubes 3.2 has support for <a href="https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/usb/#attaching-a-single-usb-device-to-a-qube-usb-passthrough">USB passthrough</a>. This one feature has made Qubes <em>so much</em> more useful for me. It means that a wide variety of devices — from my laptop’s internal webcam, to plugging in smartphones to transfer data or do Android development — are finally supported. I used to have to use a separate non-Qubes computer for several tasks that I can now more conveniently and securely do within Qubes.</p>

      <p>Bart Gellman asked me on Twitter how to make PDFs safe to open. This is an excellent question, especially for a Pulitzer-winning surveillance/national security reporter who needs to open documents from random people on the internet, who may be trying to hack him or may be a valuable new source. PDFs, and all other document formats, can be terribly dangerous, and opening a malicious one can let an attacker take over your computer.</p>
<p>He was specifically asking if <a href="https://firstlook.org/code/project/pdf-redact-tools/">PDF Redact Tools</a>, a tool that I developed to securely redact documents, could be used in Tails to safely sanitize potentially-malicious PDFs before opening them. Yes you can, but Qubes offers some built-in tools that do a better job of this, in a safer manner, with less hassle, and that’s quicker and easier.</p>

      <p>If you use Qubes like I do, you have many different AppVMs to compartmentalize different programs. You might have one VM for your email client, one for your jabber client, one for your password database. But if you click a link in any of these programs, it sure would be nice if that link opened in the browser VM of your choice. This isn’t all that hard to setup.</p>
