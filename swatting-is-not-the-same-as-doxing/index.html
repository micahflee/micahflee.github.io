      <p><strong><em>Update: KTVU has taken down the story.</em></strong></p>
<p>Recently I was interviewed about “doxing” by <a href="http://www.ktvu.com/">KTVU</a>, a Bay Area news station based in Oakland. Doxing is when someone publishes documents (“dox”) about someone to the internet. It’s usually full of mundane info that can be found in a phone book and with a google search, but sometimes it also contains more sensitive information like the contents of personal emails, lists of passwords, etc.</p>
<p>I found out that the segment aired on TV last night when someone tweeted me asking if I really thought that “swatting” was protected by free speech laws. Swatting, I learned for the first time last night, is when someone dials 911 and reports something like a hostage situation or a terrorist bomb plot at someone else’s address in order to get a SWAT team to bust down their door.</p>
<p>Here’s the <a href="http://bcove.me/tozbu14s">KTVU segment about swatting</a>*. I’m at 3:15. Here’s the <a href="http://www.ktvu.com/news/news/special-reports/swatting/nXmFr/">associated text article</a>.</p>
<p>The question I was asked was whether or not I think we should pass new laws to combat doxing (he didn’t mention the word “swatting” the entire interview). Much of the time doxing is simply re-publishing already public information, and the rest of the time the info comes from hacking into someone’s accounts online, which is already illegal. Unauthorized access to a computer system is a felony under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, so the old laws cover it pretty well.</p>
<p>Swatting? My only source of information about swatting was from watching the KTVU segment, so I feel completely uninformed about the issue.</p>
<p>Abusing emergency services is definitely something that people should never do, since (among other issues) sometimes real emergencies need them. Seems like a dick move to me. While doxing can sometimes be harmful as well, it’s not the same as swatting.</p>
