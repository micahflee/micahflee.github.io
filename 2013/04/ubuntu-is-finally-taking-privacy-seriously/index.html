      <p><strong>Update: A couple people have pointed out that the privacy changes won’t actually take affect in 14.04, which means that <a href="https://fixubuntu.com/">fixubuntu.com</a> will still be necessary until at least 14.10, which will be released in October. Oops.</strong></p>
<p>In October 2012, Canonical made a horrible mistake. They included a “feature” in Ubuntu 12.10 that has been widely considered <a href="https://www.fsf.org/blogs/rms/ubuntu-spyware-what-to-do">adware</a> and <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/1070111">spyware</a>. I blogged about the new Ubuntu’s <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/10/privacy-ubuntu-1210-amazon-ads-and-data-leaks">Amazon ads and data leaks</a> for EFF at the time, with the main ask being that Dash’s online search should be an opt-in feature and not enabled by default.</p>
<p>Ubuntu’s disregard for user privacy become the impetus that caused me to <a href="https://micahflee.com/2013/01/why-im-leaving-ubuntu-for-debian/">switch to Debian</a> (though nowadays I’m running <a href="http://qubes-os.org/trac">Qubes</a>). And in order to make it easier to fix Ubuntu’s privacy problems on new computers I helped people set up, I started the website <a href="https://fixubuntu.com/">Fix Ubuntu</a>.</p>
<p>Canonical, the company that makes Ubuntu, sent me a bogus <a href="https://micahflee.com/2013/11/canonical-shouldnt-abuse-trademark-law-to-silence-critics-of-its-privacy-decisions/">takedown notice</a> about it—later apologizing for it. While it made the privacy issue <a href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/11/canonical-abused-trademark-law-to-target-a-site-critical-of-ubuntu-privacy/">blow</a> <a href="http://www.wired.com/2013/11/fixubuntu/">up</a> <a href="http://news.slashdot.org/story/13/11/08/1335231/canonical-targets-ubuntu-privacy-critic">in</a> <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1q5ba8/canonical_abused_trademark_law_to_target_a_site/">the</a> <a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20131107/17583725174/disappointing-to-see-canonical-act-like-trademark-bully-over-ubuntu.shtml">media</a> again, Canonical still refused to fix their bad privacy choices.</p>
<p><img src="../../../2013/04/ubuntu-is-finally-taking-privacy-seriously/fixubuntu_streisand.png" alt="fixubuntu.com Streisand effect"></p>
<p>So after all of this, I’m thrilled to see that Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, which is due for release later this month, <a href="http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2014/03/ubuntu-make-amazon-product-results-opt-unity">won’t include online searches in Dash by default</a>! For the first time in a year and a half of releases, a default installation of Ubuntu won’t be phoning home with everything you type into Dash, or annoying you with unsolicited ads.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you, Canonical, for finally taking privacy seriously.</strong></p>
<p>(While I’m at it: Thank you, Edward Snowden, for making everyone finally start to take privacy seriously.)</p>
