      <p>Dude - have you taken a look at this stuff?  What goes into the 'HTTPS' handshake - there is nothing preventing the server, who chooses the final symmetric key used for the actual encryption, if implemented in house, to then send that key over to NSA.</p>
<p>Citing news just last week on the Guardian, the NSA revealed that they could indeed, even with HTTPS, see a 'snapshot of your screen' - in other words, they could intercept your gmail request/response cycle just by intercepting the transmission alone.  That means they do, in fact, have a way 'around https'...  So NO - your statement on HTTPS is a dead one - https, even though it does use encryption, is an older standard that can easily be worked around.  And since google and amazon and apple and microsoft complies, there is nothing we can actually do to prevent the NSA from getting at any of your internet traffic...</p>
<p>However, we are starting to work on our own again.  IEEE is working on a new internet encryption method, just like they designed https, to thwart this kind of interception by governments (This isn't just the US - it's going on everywhere).</p>
<p>The best answer used to be a VPN.  However, just like HTTPS they control the final key, and if they are in cahooots! with the go-go, that means the VPN is worthless - doesn't actually protect you..</p>
<p>This means one thing only - let's say I build you a browser add-on that doesn't allow any third-party communications.  That will mean no more connect.facebook, apis.google.com, ads, or cookie tracking.  However, similar things can be done entirely on the server side, which renders my app useless provided that companies then respond in that manner..</p>
<p>What about if I create a new anti-virus that indeed protects you from most malware and spyware?  I can only protect you from thrid parties, and MOSt types of stuff - not all of it, like keylogging, because NO OS actually provides you the FULL capability to monitor what's actually GOING ON on a single computer - you have the option of ONLY intercepting request packets on windows.  That doesn't give you any information on what actual program is requesting - say firefox.exe requests somethign and you give it full permissions - there is nothing preventing anybody else from calling their malware 'firefox.exe', or injecting their malware to a memory residency or an add-on to 'firefox.exe'.  And since every file and all other stuff needs to be done by 'firefox' - it means it has full reign on your OS - a HUGE hole, right there.  Something we cannot hope to defend against.</p>
<p>On top of that, let's say I completely defend the host computer, plus the data transmissions over the internet with my own VPN service - and no government can ask or demand me to do anything.  There are still ways around it, because we've sat idle with encryption for so long, because of government threats to cryptographers and researchers, that now computers have surpassed the mathematical derivitives of encryption and can brute-force any encryption standard in just two days with the latest super computer.  On top of that, I cannot protect you, say, from your own OS - if IT has a keylogger, I surely cannot create ANY software that can PREVENT its actions....</p>
<p>So there exists numerous problems on numerous levels.  So the question then becomes, who is going to be honest?  Who is trustworthy?  Because it all boils down to who can be honest and trustworthy.  And given that there's so many ways around everything, we cannot possibly hope to protect you, UNLESS the laws change in some country and we go back to researching better, more difficult to break encryption methods.  But this also has a problem - the better the encryption, usually requires longer keys, meaning the heavier encryption we do means we need faster networks.  Eventually we'll reach a bottleneck, compounding the above problems.</p>
<p>In other words, the answer doesn't lie with HTTPS.  We are going to have to find ways, as security analysts - to do just what the go-go is doing: find ways around what the go-go is doing to get around our security, and find loopholes in laws that are preventing us from providing proper security.</p>
<p>Keep in mind - I'm not worried about hackers.  I trust them much more than I do these governments right now.  When these governments get back under control - then we'll go back to our security/anti-sec fun-times.  I would say we need to start working together - both anti-sec and sec.  You guys are good at finding the problems with security - we're good at inventing new types of security.  Surely we could team up and nail at least something along those talents...</p>
