      <p>Hello Micah,</p>
<p>I believe that your first point is null and void if a site/server utilises (perfect) forward secrecy ciphers. Also, if your solution really is as good as you say why not approach the TOR people and get it implemented? I also saw lecture by Jake Applebaum who works for TOR and he said in a very matter of fact way that the TOR browser alone is not good enough and is provided because they know most people want to use it like that. He said that TAILS is how it should be used as it provides a more secure foundation. In security parlance TALIS is essentially a DMZ (demilitarised zone).</p>
<p>Second, ignore MD5, it is broken. As far as I am aware the way that PGP works is to provide not just integrity to the file/s that have been presented but it also provides authentication. This means that if the signature is tampered with even if it is on an insecure connection it can be tested and there would be NO DOUBT that the file/s would have been intercepted by a 3rd party. What I am trying to say is that there is a way of looking up and verifying the integrity of the PGP signature itself to see if it has been issued by the person you think it has been issued by. The TOR project provides a signature AND provides https I believe as a belt and braces solution.</p>
<p>Third point, if I am correct about point two then your third point has already been answered. Also I don't think it is dependent on the client software to prove the authenticity, I have a feeling it is dependent on a remote key server.</p>
<p>I do agree that https is not broken or insecure. However saying that it works "great" is rather disingenuous. There are 700+ Certificate Authorities, 95% of which I have no reason to trust and have no relationship with but necessarily am forced to trust. As Moxxy Marlinspike says we need trust agility. HTTPS is also extremely hard to configure from a server point of view. It is staggering how many companies out there actually provide insecure HTTPS. Your own site is a case in point: <a href="https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=micahflee.com">https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=micahflee.com</a> (granted there are minor issues, but my point is that even people who should know about https configure it wrongly or not very well.</p>
<p>Its not just the EFF's SSL Observatory that can be used to verify certificates. Steve Gibson is also running a nice fingerprinting service that may be of interest, located here: <a href="https://www.grc.com/fingerprints.htm">https://www.grc.com/fingerprints.htm</a></p>
<p>In a sense the users are actually correct in my view about the likes of Google, Amazon et al. Security researchers are now saying that we need to think about how we protect ourselves from abuse from these companies. The ONLY way to do that is to have a TNO (Trust No One) solution. So for the likes of cloud services encrypting data ourselves before it goes onto the internet is the only sure fire solution. Companies like CryptoCat are attempting to protect themselves from us and us from them by providing perfect forward secrecy which really is a TNO solution.</p>
<p>We also need to know the limitations of HTTPS. It is only protection of the transport layer, it is not encrypting or protecting information once it reaches the other party, it only provides protection when data is in motion.</p>
<p>I suppose the real reason that we do not see HTTPS all over the place is because of what we call "the tyranny of the default". Sites simply do not provide HTTPS because they may lack the understanding of why it is good for users, security and privacy etc. The site administrators will simply say or think "this setup has worked for me so far so why should I change anything?" In a sense users/administrators who are not technically inclined will just leave everything on the default settings. If https was provided as soon as a site was created I am sure people would simply accept it and we would see it all over the place and would become much more accustomed to it.</p>
<p>An excuse the people generally employ is that https is slower than standard http connection. Whilst this is technically correct really this is a laughable concern in this day and age because even on tablets and phones we have fast enough processors to deal with even the most complicated forward secret cryptography.</p>
<p>Micah, why doesn't your site provide Strict Transport Security (HSTS)? If you are going to tell sites to use HTTPS in as many situations as possible then please at least start with your own site for anyone to take you even remotely seriously.</p>
