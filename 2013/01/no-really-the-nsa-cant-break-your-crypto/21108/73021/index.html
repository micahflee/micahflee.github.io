      <p>It's years later but I thought it worth responding to this well reasoned fear. The seed data GPG uses comes from linux <code>/dev/random</code> which collects data from keyboard, mouse inputs and device activity. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5635277/is-dev-random-considered-truly-random">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5635277/is-dev-random-considered-truly-random</a>
 It won't actually return values until it's satisfied enough "random" things have happened. As the linked Q&amp;A says there are still some biases in its output - clearly humans and exhibit some broadly predictable patterns - but this is much too broad to practically narrow down the search space much. i.e. I can predict that there's a 1% chance you might type a particular word but could I guess that the first letter would be at exactly at microsecond number 8337593 and the second one at 9129483 and so on?</p>
<p>If the NSA were to somehow hide pieces of malice in linux they probably wouldn't do it here, rather they'd choose to promote an encryption methods for which they had discovered systemic flaws.</p>
<p>In fact, we know their methods are not so much to rely on testing the limits of theoretical possibility but instead to</p>
<ul>
<li>use legislation to try banning good encryption such as PGP.</li>
<li>use certain cultural and organisational channels to promote practice which they know (or many people know) to be insecure e.g. HTTPS</li>
</ul>
<p>PGP looks to be holding out: <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/12/28/7458159/encryption-standards-the-nsa-cant-crack-pgp-tor-otr-snowden">http://www.theverge.com/2014/12/28/7458159/encryption-standards-the-nsa-cant-crack-pgp-tor-otr-snowden</a></p>

      <p>I take it all back. Just found this and realised how I had forgotten Linus really is the dictator of Linux.
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6336505">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6336505</a></p>
<p>I was going to joke 'hey perhaps Linus Torvalds really works for the NSA" but really it's not so far fetched.
A lot of ideas are far fetched e.g. the weird guy in the office is a Government spy.
But this would not be a surprising headline: "US Government makes secret deal with the one of the most powerful people in the world"  Some points which make him amongst the most powerful people in internet security.</p>
<p>1) He has autocratic power over many Linux distributions.
2) Linux runs the great majority of the internet's servers.
3) Unlike a CEO in charge of CPUs there isn't a chain of command to get down to the engineers doing the deed.</p>
<p>So he's a very high value target for them. What might put him in the sweet spot of also being an easy target?</p>
<p>1) Unlike a politician he is under little journalistic scrutiny.
2) Unlike a business leader he has no worries about board oversight, customers or many powerful stakeholders.
3) By his own admission he is motivated by a love of programming and selfish desires, not an ideology like open source or privacy: <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/linus_torvalds_the_mind_behind_linux#t-731551">http://www.ted.com/talks/linus_torvalds_the_mind_behind_linux#t-731551</a>
4) His reputation for rudeness and 'Linus just being Linus' serve as a good pretext for his regular overruling of other contributors. Helps deflect suspicion.
5) If saying no to the Government is illegal and dangerous, whereas saying yes is law-abiding and carries benefits (like maybe American citizenship) you'd need a strong moral fear about the effect on your country to resist. America isn't his only country so he might perhaps feel a bit more distant from its troubles.</p>
<p>Although his autocratic technical actions are out in the open for skilled reviewers to see we can see just how big a wave their biggest protests produce. Just look back up at that obscure hackernews thread.</p>
