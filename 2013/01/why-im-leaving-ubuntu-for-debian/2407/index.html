      <p>!!-Joke Alert-!!</p>
<p>I think your all evil, every single person writing here is using free software along with tainted  proprietary BIOS code !!
No one should use proprietary software !!! Remove your BIOS !! Remove all other firmware from your mouse etc too !!
!!-Joke Ends-!!</p>
<p>I'm a happy user of Ubuntu LTS precise 12.04.4, it rocks.
When I hear Richard Stallman on youtube tears come in my eyes and I agree with most he is saying, Linux needs people like him, it's good that the argument he makes is pushed.</p>
<p>That said I need a usable PC, and when I buy a graphics card for 200+ Euro I want it to work.
I use proprietary drivers in Windows XP &amp; Windows 7 (I got a triple boot system), why would I now not use these drivers in Linux ?.? I payed for these drivers .... So I'm going to use them.</p>
<p>If a GPU maker comes along that can give me just as great graphics as Nvidia can and also gives me GNU GPL licensed drivers, great I will go for that, reality is though there is no such thing around to chose.</p>
<p>I started Linux once with Red Hat and later Open Suse, and got 3D running, after maybe a week of trying stuff, finally on my Open Suse box, I was amazed back then to run some 3D games.</p>
<p>Ubuntu is much more easier though, proprietary drivers are handed to you and stuff just works out of the box. Nowadays I run stuff in Linux I could have never dreamed of before, I run Civilization IV, Tropico, Planeshift, Day of Defeat, Half Life, Counter Strike, Team Fortress 2, Dota 2 and mostly World of Tanks.</p>
<p>I run World of Tanks with Wine 1.7.4-CSMT @ 30~72 frames per second at max settings on my Geforce GTX 660, there is a great Ubuntu community out there, and always people who experience the same problems as you as Ubuntu has so many users. I only go to Windows if stuff really doesn't work in Linux.</p>
<p>12.04s dash is not phoning home to Amazone (a feature that can be switch off in privacy settings with a simple click in v13) and other stuff people don't like can be easily replaced. I have no problems with Canonical trying to make a buck, although I agree that the Amazone thing in dash should be opt-in.
I have blocked also some other persistent internet connections to Canonical, like geo-ip and I do not use Canonicals NTP time servers. Some Canonical addresses simply point to 127.0.01 in the hosts file.</p>
<p>It sort of amuses me though that people who claim that they want the freedom to change their OS the way they want it to work, don't change stuff but immediately go to another OS if one feature of the standard package in an OS is not what they like. I plan to stay with Ubuntu as long as it's the easiest and most supported OS, specially game wise. Valve's Steam is officially supporting Ubuntu and that's for me good enough of a reason to stay on Ubuntu. Unless people rather see me gaming on Windows of cause ;)</p>
<p>Why am I playing games on Linux rather then the two other OSes installed ?
Ease of use, in Ubuntu virtually all programs are in the repository, only some games I play are not and they auto-update as soon as you start them. I'm very lazy and Ubuntu helps me not to worry and be lazy, thank you Ubuntu :)
 Of cause it's also fun playing around with Linux, but Linux is finally getting somewhere. Linux needs kids, moms &amp; grandfathers who want to use it, Linux is still cool, people want to use it, but the reason people don't, is because Linux can not do all the stuff people want to do with their PC. A PC is a machine that's there to do the things people want to do with a PC, play games, talk to friends, listen to music and movies etc. Most normal people do not care at all if Debian is more stable then Ubuntu or if Arch Linux is more hipper than thou, people want a usable PC and Ubuntu is trying to give that to people. In the end most support by game company's will go to the Linux that is most used, and with 0.5% of total global OS shares that's Ubuntu.</p>
