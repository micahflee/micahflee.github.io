      <p>One of the main reasons why is because linux in most cases is faster than windows.</p>
<p>Although that's changing, especially since Gnome 3 and Unity came out. I noticed that Fedora and Ubuntu has gotten worse in terms of performance and usability.</p>
<p>I don't do much customizing, but performance has always been the reason for me. Plus it's cool to use switch things up a little.</p>
<p>It seems like Mint is the new thing now.</p>

      <p>I'm curious in what cases Linux would be faster than windows. AMD, for example, is focusing on speed on its windows drivers and focusing on stability when it comes to linux drivers. I fully expect opencl to perform better on windows than on linux.</p>

      <p>I don't have much experience with AMD graphic cards, but nVidia's graphic cards kick ass on linux [1], [2]. I expect the nVidia drivers to be on par or better than the windows drivers.</p>

      <p>I have an AMD A8-5600k APU. Oddly enough the latest Windows Catalyst drivers won't do as high a resolution as the open source AMD drivers on Xubuntu Linux. My experience with AMD drivers for old hardware is less than stellar, but I was impressed with the driver for the APU.</p>

      <p>This is an old post. I realize that. 
To answer your question with low level knowledge. 
Not having an AV scanner, scanning every file that the OS requests prior to actually loading it into memory for actual use, doubles the I/O speed throughput.</p>
<p>Having ALL of your programs update when your ready to update. Updating in the background, even while your using those programs, and NO reboot (except for a Kernel update) increases productivity.</p>
<p>Programs that are in the Kilobyte size, rairly in the Megabyte size, versus the Megabyte size or Gigabyte size dramatically improves load times. To verify my numbers, look at the Windows version of Firefox versus the Linux version of Firefox. Smaller program footprint means less RAM requirements and little to no virtual memory and disk thrashing.</p>
<p>The background file scanning so the context sensitive, 'is this what you wanted to work on' can find your programs and documents, is given a very small priority CPU wise and less ram requirements. So there is a lot less disk thrashing and virtual memory swapping for this task.</p>
<p>Another thing that most people aren't aware of is microsofts method to make applications 'seem' to launch faster is to load the most used applications into memory upon boot. Filling up all available ram and causing virtual memory to need to be accessed more. Don't forget that the AV scanner also effects this process. Chewing up valuable CPU time.</p>
<p>Those are the most common reasons why Windows computes run at 1/2 the speed of your average Linux computer.</p>
<p>Having used both Microsoft and Linux. Another speculative reason is sales. I have noticed since Win3.1 that a couple of months before the release of a new version of Windows. Windows Updates tend to brick your computer to the point that your so frustrated with it and it's poor performance that you want to throw it out and buy the latest version. I've tested this theory by doing a fresh install and denying the auto-update. Not a safe way to opperate a windows computer. Not a Microsoft approved way to opperate a windows computer. But if will regain it's full operating speed. When I see "critical security update". I have learned that the text should read, "critical to microsofts financial security update".</p>

      <p>I have upgraded several working Windows computers to Linux. Those same machines operate at, easily, double the speed. Stopwatch used.</p>
<p>If you are doing a very CPU intensive process such as photo realistic 3D rendering or Pi to a million places. The difference is not that much. The Linux machine tends to be only 1/3 faster.</p>

      <p>I can relate... but I think people exaggerate a lil.</p>
<p>I have used Debian since 1996 or so.  Liked it better than slack.  Ran unstable on my desktop pc and stable on a home server.    Switched to Ubuntu on my desktop pc when it looked like it was becoming a nice desktop os.</p>
<p>I learned to like fvwm's low hunger for resources when I was using hpux.  I used fvwm on linux since my slack days, continued that on Debian and Ubuntu, until I bought a new pc with more than enough spare cycles for the desktop bs.</p>
<p>I didn't like Unity at all, fixed that bug like this:
<code>
apt-get install xubuntu-desktop
</code></p>
<p>I now run XFCE with 2 xfce-panels, one at the top as a start menu/systray/ task bar/etc, one bottom right with only a 3x3 "workspace shifter" I could configure to behave like my FvwmPager.  I have 1 big monitor and luv the virtual desktop.  Do I mind that's not the default?  No!  The default has never been what I want anyways.  Also, I perfectly understand why most people wouldn't want to use fvwm, for example.</p>
<p>I don't use Ubuntu One or the search or whatever people complain about.  I know it exists but other than that I have no clue what they're talking about.  I guess it's gone once you install xubuntu-desktop and get rid of unity.</p>
<p>I have used the software center a couple of times, even for proprietary software.  I need Skype sometimes and I'm grateful Ubuntu provides a way to install it.  I don't feel like it turned my desktop into something evil. If RMS doesn't like it, that's his problem, not mine.</p>
<p>I have no idea what Ubuntu's package manager is like because I got used to dselect a long time ago and to apt-get only a little later.  Together they do all I want easily and quicklike so why would I bother with anything else?  I use the graphical updater tho, because it's a lil lazier than using dselect or apt-get in an xterm.</p>
<p>I just upgraded from 10.4 to 14.whatever-it-is-now, with just one glitch.  Xorg was very unstable, I had to get it to work with a different video driver.  Not bad for such an upgrade, I'd say.</p>
<p>Do I mind Canonical making a buck or two with adds or proprietary software?  No!</p>
<p>They still provide an easy way for me to run a linux on my desktop.  Thank you Canonical!
Do I fear any lockin from Canonical?  No!  There's PLENTY of linux distro's to choose from if Canonical's commercial interests get in my way.  They don't, since there's an easy way to get rid of the bs.</p>
<p>Would I want to switch back to Debian on my desktop pc?  No, even tho it served me well for years,  I can be lazier with Ubuntu.  I still like it.</p>
<p>I will give Mint a go tho, just out of curiosity.</p>
