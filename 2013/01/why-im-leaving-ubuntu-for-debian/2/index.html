      <p>I have tried Linux desktop (or laptop) a few times, but it has never seemed worth the effort. It makes sense on the server, though. I am not sufficiently religious about the freedom that open source gives me to make the extra effort and hassle worthwhile. Of course I mostly work on Windows software, that is what our clients want.</p>
<p>I admire people like you who are willing to do the extra work to live with Linux on the desktop.</p>
<p>I agree Ubuntu is a disappointment, but it has to be pretty difficult to run a business that give away its' product.</p>

      <p>Crossroads: Commercial Ubuntu and Open Ubuntu?</p>
<p>Personally i have made my choice over two years ago: i moved to Linux Mint. Perfect for me, my wife, my son, one of my daughter, my father and couple of my friends and relatives  i have helped to choose Mint too.</p>

      <p>I tried Linux Mint, and as soon as I got an ad due to their use of <a href="http://forums.linuxmint.com/viewtopic.php?f=90&amp;t=128529" rel="nofollow">OpenDNS</a>, I  decided it was time to switch to Debian as well.</p>
<p>However, the lack of stand-by function in gnome-panels, a stable Nvidia graphics driver, an up-to-date browser, a recent version of glibc and so on make me consider installing Ubuntu again (Obviously without Unity). On the other hand, their upcoming Mir display server makes me agree with the "Ubuntu is pulling an Apple." statement.</p>

      <p>Beware Mint, it's based on Ubuntu so <em>two</em> steps removed from "pure" Debian and not all releases are platformed from an Ubuntu LTS release, which means critical bugs (like Heartbleed, for example) we're not patched for some Mint releases and they remain vulnerable unless the Mint user was savvy enough to realise and manually patch <em>or</em> upgrade to a new / LTS-based Mint version. All in all, not great. Personally, I use Fedora for a desktop. I find it the best desktop Linux distribution, have done for some years. Many colleagues use Debian and GNOME3 without issue. No one I know uses Ubuntu any more, even less Mint.</p>

      <p>Only partially true.</p>
<p>The "standard" Mint is indeed based on Ubuntu, but mostly just uses their repositories. Mint also is available as pure Debian in their versions LMDE and LMDE2.   LMDE2 is all I use on all of my computers. No Ubuntu at all here.</p>

      <p>Mint wouldn't make my  bluetooth work (streaming audio), it locked up and wouldn't let me even remove devices.
 something in the tools in unity  gets streaming audio right  even ubuntu mate doesn't get it right. 
No other distro I've found  gets bluetooth right . I tried a bunch on 4 identical thinkpads.</p>

      <p>One of the main reasons why is because linux in most cases is faster than windows.</p>
<p>Although that's changing, especially since Gnome 3 and Unity came out. I noticed that Fedora and Ubuntu has gotten worse in terms of performance and usability.</p>
<p>I don't do much customizing, but performance has always been the reason for me. Plus it's cool to use switch things up a little.</p>

      <p>I'm curious in what cases Linux would be faster than windows. AMD, for example, is focusing on speed on its windows drivers and focusing on stability when it comes to linux drivers. I fully expect opencl to perform better on windows than on linux.</p>

      <p>I have an AMD A8-5600k APU. Oddly enough the latest Windows Catalyst drivers won't do as high a resolution as the open source AMD drivers on Xubuntu Linux. My experience with AMD drivers for old hardware is less than stellar, but I was impressed with the driver for the APU.</p>

      <p>This is an old post. I realize that. 
To answer your question with low level knowledge. 
Not having an AV scanner, scanning every file that the OS requests prior to actually loading it into memory for actual use, doubles the I/O speed throughput.</p>
<p>Having ALL of your programs update when your ready to update. Updating in the background, even while your using those programs, and NO reboot (except for a Kernel update) increases productivity.</p>
<p>Programs that are in the Kilobyte size, rairly in the Megabyte size, versus the Megabyte size or Gigabyte size dramatically improves load times. To verify my numbers, look at the Windows version of Firefox versus the Linux version of Firefox. Smaller program footprint means less RAM requirements and little to no virtual memory and disk thrashing.</p>
<p>The background file scanning so the context sensitive, 'is this what you wanted to work on' can find your programs and documents, is given a very small priority CPU wise and less ram requirements. So there is a lot less disk thrashing and virtual memory swapping for this task.</p>
<p>Another thing that most people aren't aware of is microsofts method to make applications 'seem' to launch faster is to load the most used applications into memory upon boot. Filling up all available ram and causing virtual memory to need to be accessed more. Don't forget that the AV scanner also effects this process. Chewing up valuable CPU time.</p>
<p>Those are the most common reasons why Windows computes run at 1/2 the speed of your average Linux computer.</p>
<p>Having used both Microsoft and Linux. Another speculative reason is sales. I have noticed since Win3.1 that a couple of months before the release of a new version of Windows. Windows Updates tend to brick your computer to the point that your so frustrated with it and it's poor performance that you want to throw it out and buy the latest version. I've tested this theory by doing a fresh install and denying the auto-update. Not a safe way to opperate a windows computer. Not a Microsoft approved way to opperate a windows computer. But if will regain it's full operating speed. When I see "critical security update". I have learned that the text should read, "critical to microsofts financial security update".</p>

      <p>I have upgraded several working Windows computers to Linux. Those same machines operate at, easily, double the speed. Stopwatch used.</p>
<p>If you are doing a very CPU intensive process such as photo realistic 3D rendering or Pi to a million places. The difference is not that much. The Linux machine tends to be only 1/3 faster.</p>

      <p>I can relate... but I think people exaggerate a lil.</p>
<p>I have used Debian since 1996 or so.  Liked it better than slack.  Ran unstable on my desktop pc and stable on a home server.    Switched to Ubuntu on my desktop pc when it looked like it was becoming a nice desktop os.</p>
<p>I learned to like fvwm's low hunger for resources when I was using hpux.  I used fvwm on linux since my slack days, continued that on Debian and Ubuntu, until I bought a new pc with more than enough spare cycles for the desktop bs.</p>
<p>I didn't like Unity at all, fixed that bug like this:
<code>
apt-get install xubuntu-desktop
</code></p>
<p>I now run XFCE with 2 xfce-panels, one at the top as a start menu/systray/ task bar/etc, one bottom right with only a 3x3 "workspace shifter" I could configure to behave like my FvwmPager.  I have 1 big monitor and luv the virtual desktop.  Do I mind that's not the default?  No!  The default has never been what I want anyways.  Also, I perfectly understand why most people wouldn't want to use fvwm, for example.</p>
<p>I don't use Ubuntu One or the search or whatever people complain about.  I know it exists but other than that I have no clue what they're talking about.  I guess it's gone once you install xubuntu-desktop and get rid of unity.</p>
<p>I have used the software center a couple of times, even for proprietary software.  I need Skype sometimes and I'm grateful Ubuntu provides a way to install it.  I don't feel like it turned my desktop into something evil. If RMS doesn't like it, that's his problem, not mine.</p>
<p>I have no idea what Ubuntu's package manager is like because I got used to dselect a long time ago and to apt-get only a little later.  Together they do all I want easily and quicklike so why would I bother with anything else?  I use the graphical updater tho, because it's a lil lazier than using dselect or apt-get in an xterm.</p>
<p>I just upgraded from 10.4 to 14.whatever-it-is-now, with just one glitch.  Xorg was very unstable, I had to get it to work with a different video driver.  Not bad for such an upgrade, I'd say.</p>
<p>Do I mind Canonical making a buck or two with adds or proprietary software?  No!</p>
<p>They still provide an easy way for me to run a linux on my desktop.  Thank you Canonical!
Do I fear any lockin from Canonical?  No!  There's PLENTY of linux distro's to choose from if Canonical's commercial interests get in my way.  They don't, since there's an easy way to get rid of the bs.</p>
<p>Would I want to switch back to Debian on my desktop pc?  No, even tho it served me well for years,  I can be lazier with Ubuntu.  I still like it.</p>
<p>I will give Mint a go tho, just out of curiosity.</p>

      <p>I totally agree with this guy because Ubuntu is plenty "Debian-based"; but I respect Ubuntu as a OS; you even figure out how to actually perform certain tasks to the point where I can firmly say Ubuntu has given a better outlook/education on system interoperabilitie[s] in relevancy to those topics.I paid to use Linux in 2001-2004, and was happy with SLAX for casual studying during Summer[s]. It didn't even matter though, being an average Windows geek wasn't too bad [I was scanning my subnets &amp;/or [finding subnets from different places and scanning those] through NetBIOS;139, and found a lot of computers suffering from Lack of Password disease... Yeah I never trusted Windows since 3.1 or 1995, or 1998se+. I gave up just 3 years ago after trying for 5 years how to manage Windows in a functional useable format. Yeah right. It's business strategy; make a system that breaks in time &amp; usage. That's how we'll help all the Hardware vendors make money with us too ~Microsoft. Yeah if you know what. I'm running Debian in 2014; I used to use Ubuntu from 2010. Switched back to Windows because I felt I was lacking a bit on it so I studied it up to know what to do [even had a goal to make it employable for service]. Wouldn't risk it. Even malware these days surpasses the administrative level to through registry edits which lie to your Anti-Virus about being there so remain hidden [using a true Microsoft program]. Mhm there's a reason Windows is used in schools and government, and it's good to know how to use... Sure. I'm aiming for a higher reach in understanding foundational aspects of systems and their layered functions so I wouldn't bother a noob and tell him to use Debian, I'd recommend Ubuntu, Not saying Ubuntu is only for novilce level type people but these days I run LanaDelRey OS. Because I don't even like reading Debian on my system. &amp; for the not quaint, install it on Windows and progress if you care to learn... I use Debian stable for personal use. My business environments wouldn't be.</p>

      <p>Then you don't really know what you are looking for.. Or, you didn't look far enough.. Unlike Windows.  Linux has dozens of completely different GUI's called desktop enviroments.  Look up screen shots of Kubuntu and Linux mint.  They are very Win7'ish in feel and looks.  Linux can run most windows programs.  It has a few and 100% or closely compatible program that is free, in which on Windows it cost 100's (or thousands) of dollars.  And <em>some</em> versions has an app store much like Android &amp; Iphone.   MOST programs from these pseudo-app stores are free.  They also automatically download, automatically install, and it automatically places a icon on the "start menu" and work perfectly.  Also, unlike Windows's start menu, each program type is automatically organized under categories like "Internet" , "Office" , "Graphics", "Media" ect ect..   Windows piles every single program into one huge clunk on their start menu. .  If Windows 8 is your thing then there are many Win8 concept type of Linux variants too.  You may want to stick with something Like Ubuntu, Kubuntu, or Linux Mint, these are all VERY easy to install. You will not need any driver disk, and will not have to configure any hardware at all if you choose to do the auto-install.</p>

      <p>I have to agree with you, I have been a contribuitor to ubuntu in many ways.  Unfortunately I feel that
Ubuntu has pull the carpet from under our feet.  with this new release of 12.10  I believe that they have managed to keep many follwers out in the dark.
they manage to start a parade of good people leaving.</p>
<p>Sorry we have to see people like  jumping the boat too.</p>

      <p>Ubuntu runs way better and faster than disaster called Windows 10 which is also the biggest spyware around. Everything works out of the box on my ThinkPad laptops and my Skylake desktop. In fact the ThinkPad X250 came with Windows 8.1 and by 10, the system was crawling whereas in same system, Ubuntu LTS flies.</p>
