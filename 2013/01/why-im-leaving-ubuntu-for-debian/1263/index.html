      <p>I hate to see you flee Micah. Stay and see Ubuntu evolve into a single global harmonious Linux system that will run on anything, will run everything.  You, like so many, are not seeing what is happening. It is evolution, change, growth towards a new, as yet undreamed of, entity striving for survival and, ultimately, control of its environment. 
Ubuntu IS your future. Relax and accept it. Study the forces that cause it to move in the direction it has taken, consider the fates of those that have not taken these turns and adaptations, sift through the silicon sands to discover the failures that have died along the way and piece together those advantages that have survived change and embrace the organism that has emerged and you will find Ubuntu. 
Micah, Ubuntu is your mother. Ubuntu gave you birth, guided you and taught you the true meaning of FREEDOM and how to survive on your own. Ubuntu set you free in a world of snares and predations and licenses and EULAs that have been a tarpit for all the other distros. 
Ubuntu alone will walk with you into the next period of existence, the Cybercene Era, the age of machines and men fused into an inseperable, indistinguishable, living, thinking, symbiotic organism grasping for understanding and control of the world and universe in which they exist.
You are so young, Micah. You have only lived a few years. You will be lost if you run away, confused, always chasing after every distro that promises you milk but gives you piss. Stay with you mother, Micah, and drink her milk. Grow strong. Sit at her feet and learn. She will give you lessons every day that will guide you your entire life.
Take your mother's milk and strengthen your body, let her be your guide every day you interact with the world around you, let her bring truths and revelations and knowledge to you. Let her be the shield, the firewall, the protector that sifts all that is and let her present to you what is good and nourishing to your soul. Do not trust strangers to do this.
You are the child of Ubuntu. Stay rooted with her and grow with her. Learn all you can from her. Do not allow yourself to become a flaccid, placid shirker, a lurker in dark, ill defined distros adorned with perfumes, plucked eyebrows and fancy dresses that hide the corruptions, the illnesses, the evils within. They will lead you down dark passages to nowhere.
You are the child of Ubuntu. All children, when their mother taught them to walk, want to run from her, they want to be adults but they do not know the costs, the sufferings, the agonies that they have to pass through.
Your mother has dressed you, given you the clothes you need. As you have grown your clothes have changed, the diapers gave way to underwear, and you put off your pajamas for jeans. She taught you a new way to express yourself, she gave you new styles to explore and to make you look good.  She is readying you for your high school prom. She has given you a new suit to wear. You may feel strange in that suit but it is good. Your mother knows it is good and one day you will realize that it was good for you. And you realize your mother is good and she is forgiving. She is good and she is waiting. She is good and she will rejoice when you return to her.</p>

      <p>Ubuntu is a PRODUCT from canonical, . It comes from a commercial site (.com). Don't let any body deceive you, little tiger!</p>

      <p>Not to burst your bubble of insanity, but I do hope you know that Ubuntu was born from Debian. So rather in the way of your saying, Micah has found God (which is Debian). So to counter your siggestivism, you better switch to Debian right this moment!</p>
