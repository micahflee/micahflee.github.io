      <p>You are listing all things that pretty much any comercial (not proprietary) OS is doing. I personally do not use ubuntu (I go between debian, kubuntu, os x, and a modified ipad3 for my desktop tasks), but I do think they are the closes to building a common consistent comercial variant of linux that most people can use. I would much rather have ubuntu out of the box on a pc I bought than windows, and I think that is the direction canonocal wants to go. So it makes sense that they dable in some of the things that the comercial systems like os x, android, chrome os, windows, and the android variant that runs on the kindle are all doing (paid for apps on app stores, advertisment, etc). I don't disagree with your reasons for switching from ubuntu, but I'd say at least give them credit for trying to get linux on more desktops out there where so many distros have failed.</p>

      <p>I really like this comment.  I acknowledges the very real problems with what Ubuntu is doing, but it also searches for ways we can take the positive out of the Ubuntu model.  We are searching for ways FOSS can grow and spread, and maybe Ubuntu will get swallowed by the proprientary world, or maybe it will die, or maybe it will re-liberate itself from the Amazon nonsense, but whatever happens, we can learn lessons from their experience and try to increase the number of active users who are ready to take control over their computing ecosystem and connect with other users for mutual support.  Maybe Mint can mobilize these lessons quickly.  It seems it is already combining usability with non-commercialization...</p>

      <p>I know this is an old post, but this is exactly correct.
Ubuntu is Linux <em>for the masses</em>. It's not for the hackers and the programmers who just want a CLI OS.
If you want to get Win/Mac users to switch, then you need to have things that PAID OSes already have.
Driver support. Users don't want to Google for wifi drivers and compile them, they want it TO WORK.
Easily-Installable Apps. Win/Mac users are USED to paying for apps; the Ubuntu Software Center isn't a surprise for anyone who isn't a die-hard FOSS fan.
Having things just work out of the box. I paid my dues, I spent my hours setting up distro after distro and tweaking each one to be exactly what I needed at the moment, but most normal users don't want this! An OS, with a few preferences they can change, that runs solid and looks beautiful and supports software is all 80% of the population needs. If it's free, even better - though honestly, after dealing with distro after distro, I've started donating to Ubuntu - BECAUSE IT WORKS, and I don't have to mess with it anymore. 
13.10 is a rock-solid OS, and Unity is a fresh new look (it's what Win 8 Metro should have been, really). 
I could give Ubuntu to my mother, and she could use it reliably. Probably Mint too, although she'd probably think it's ugly/antiquated looking after comparing it to win 8 or Unity.
Anyway... Ubuntu may not be Linux for Everyone, but I definitely think it's the first real step toward a usable, beautiful Linux that could honestly convert some other-OS users.</p>
