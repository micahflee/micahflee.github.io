      <p>I strongly suspect/believe Ubuntu to be a Trojan horse within the Free Software movement/community. A way to try to control it, and divert it from its real or original purposes.</p>
<p>It's not just the Amazon spying on our desktops and the proprietary programs that Ubuntu tries to convince us to install. Notice the <b>"Zeitgeist" daemon</b>, that records almost all of our desktop activities - that Ubuntu implements by default, without warning of its presence - and <b>whose development is sponsored by Canonical</b>.</p>
<p>All it takes is for someone to simply try, for a few minutes, a proprietary program on his/her computer (maybe one of the many promoted by Ubuntu, on its Software Centre), also for that proprietary program to be one that reads your most sensitive files (like Skype is known to do, or at least did, in the past - <a href="http://linux.slashdot.org/story/07/08/26/1312256/skype-linux-reads-password-and-firefox-profile">http://linux.slashdot.org/story/07/08/26/1312256/skype-linux-reads-password-and-firefox-profile</a>), and there goes a whole log of your desktop activity into the hands of Big Brother.</p>
<p>Even the name and the logo chosen by the Canonical corporation are, to me, very revealing...</p>
<p>The meaning of the word "Ubuntu" reminds me of the "Brotherhood" organization in the <i>Nineteen Eighty-Four</i> novel. (Read the book.)</p>
<p>And Ubuntu's logo is <i>identical</i> to the British equivalent of the NSA's headquarters' layout (check the following aerial photograph: <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/GCHQ-aerial.jpg/1024px-GCHQ-aerial.jpg">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/GCHQ-aerial.jpg/1024px-GCHQ-aerial.jpg</a>). Not only that, but that same logo is one of many corporate ones from which you can draw a very well-known triangle (<a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-nzdNSZCll4k/UcBj0r0AyYI/AAAAAAAAAzQ/wfjlwVA2QsE/s1600/ubuntu_occult.png">http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-nzdNSZCll4k/UcBj0r0AyYI/AAAAAAAAAzQ/wfjlwVA2QsE/s1600/ubuntu_occult.png</a>) used by a secret society of which almost all the major capitalists and political leaders are members of. (Isn't Mark Shuttleworth a top capitalist, of British nationality?)</p>
<p>Who founded Canonical? A billionaire and venture capitalist, who has made a fortune surely not from adopting free and open culture standards and concepts. (Did his companies refused to use patents?)</p>
<p>Who's Canonical's current CEO? Someone who came from one of the top positions in the US arms industry.</p>
<p>Do you all really believe that these are people who are "anti-establishment", and who want to change our world for better?</p>
<p>Don't be naïve. If you seriously want to adhere to - or be part of - any movement, like the Free Software one, read about the history of movements that defy the establishment, and about the whole record of traps and dirty tricks that that same establishment uses to try to destroy such opposing movements.</p>
<p>Firefox products are no real alternative to me, either.</p>
<p>The fact that the people behind Firefox have designed their browser in a way that allows for Big Brother to have a look at your sensitive files (<a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2015/08/06/firefox-exploit-found-in-the-wild/">https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2015/08/06/firefox-exploit-found-in-the-wild/</a>), and the fact that their "Firefox OS" (actually, little more than a browser) leads you to make everything over the Internet, is a way for Big Brother - who is known to be watching our Internet connections (listen to Snowden, and the likes) - to know a lot about what you do on your computers.</p>
<p>Same thing as Google (a known CIA-front company - <a href="http://forums.debian.net/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;amp;t=117545&amp;amp;start=15#p562937">http://forums.debian.net/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;amp;t=117545&amp;amp;start=15#p562937</a>) does, with its "Chrome OS". A browser made by a company that goes on pretending to like Free and Open Source Software, and that then repeatedly subverts it with proprietary additions, resulting in the most insecure (and laughable) OS that I've ever heard of (Android) - in which, not surprisingly, security holes are constantly being found (example: <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2015/07/27/426613020/major-flaw-in-android-phones-would-let-hackers-in-with-just-a-text">http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2015/07/27/426613020/major-flaw-in-android-phones-would-let-hackers-in-with-just-a-text</a>).</p>
<p>Signed,</p>
<p>Someone who also started using Ubuntu as his main OS in 2005, for the same reasons stated in the article, and that has recently switched to Debian</p>

<p>"The best way to control the opposition is to lead it ourselves."
― Vladimir Ilich Lenin</p>
<p>(Don't you all think that the big corporations who have a lot to loose from this Free Software movement wouldn't try to subvert and control the latter?)</p>
