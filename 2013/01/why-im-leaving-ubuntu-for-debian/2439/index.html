      <p>I also switched from Ubuntu 10.04 LTS to Wheezy.
It was not easy to install Debian, I could not install Grub nor LILO, until I zeroed all the unused space in the disk, and the partition table, just leaved the boot sector.
And installed Debian placing the disk in an USB case, as recomended in some help forum.
After that the installation was terse. Now Debian is running fine, much more faster than Ubuntu, because it does not install uneeded daemons.
Now I configured Gnome 3, with a menu similat to the previous version, which I already know.
I do not like to change everything just to follow a sutpid fashion, like the iDiots avid to buy the last gadget just to earn a status of adict-conumer.
When one use a computer to work, one does not want to waste time learning how to use the computer as a beginer just because one marketting expert changes everithing to look differtent with a false promise to be better.
Many people adopted Ubuntu from Windows, because they were tired of all the unneeded services (daemons) that just slows the machine. Windows also has a cryptic way to configure, with the false argument that their interface is easier for users.
Android is a derivative of Linux, but not free, it also has a cryptic configuration, and an App Store that spyes what one installs.
Ubuntu is becoming a new android like system.</p>
<p>You are wrong saying that Apps is how the programs are called now, let me explain the difference:
App is a name formed by the first 3 letters of the word Application, as such, it is just a part of an application.  For that reason, Apps are incomplete programs, got it?</p>
<p>That is an important limitation of Android, the available "Apps" are fragments of programs, you need to download many either bought or gratis Apps to have some functionallity that could have with a similar program that you can download from a true GNU/OS distro.</p>
<p>Tired of all the incongruent changes of Ubuntu, I decided a new attempt to install Debian, this time, which took me too much time, but after all I have a succesfull installation.
I know that Slackware is hardest to install but much more stable because one compiles everything. When I have time to explore it I will.</p>
<p>Freedom is important, more in nowdays where ACTA is gaining the adderence of many corrupt governments like the mexican which signed it against the recommendation of the past congress. The new congress changed all the constitution even in the stated as unchangable principles with no discussion, one of the laws under discussion is more radical than ACTA being more intrusive.  Poor mexicans they are not even aware of that yet.</p>
<p>Move to GNU/OSes that adder to freedom ideals, Ubuntu is a fake free os.</p>
