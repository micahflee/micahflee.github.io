      <p>I'm with Peter on this one. I'm a happy Windows user who only came to Linux and Ubuntu because the £50 refurb Dell I picked up on eBay came OSless. I really like it. It's quick, easy and does what I need it to. But to pretend that it is any realistic replacement for the PCs I use at work is absurd. Until there is decent money to be made from users - somehow, any how - then software on Linux will remain generally behind its competitors.</p>
<p>Complaints about Unity remind me of my colleagues at work moaning vociferously about "terrible Windows 8" or "awful Vista" and proudly explaining that they resurrected a copy of Windows ME off some old CD-ROMs to get a decent operating system (I still like XP since <i>it just works</i>. Unity is not a terrible mistake. It's progress. You'd get used to it. For me the worst thing is that whole menu-in-the-top-bar-not-the-window thing. That's terrible UX as far as I'm concerned. Is that Unity? I don't suppose it is; it's a feature of OSX too so I imagine it's a *nix thing (I wouldn't know, and as time goes by, I doubt I'll care for much longer - I'll get used to it).</p>
<p>Stallman used the phrase "free as in free speech, not as in beer", but it seems to me the complaints always are about a lack of free beer - like moochers at a party not bothering to bring their own bottle.</p>
<p>I donate to Wikipedia and try to make some contributions to various FOSS projects as and when I can, or I can convince employers it's a fair thing to do. If all Canonical ask in return for their pretty and easy to use OS is an attempt to try to sell me some stuff I can choose to ignore, or even just switch off, I think it's a pretty good trade.</p>

      <p>I'm not going to name drop here, but I've been an active developer, volunteering my time free of charge for years, to a certain Linux distro.  I've never complained about anything, and never had the slightest urge to use anything other than a UNIX like operating system.  The last time I paid for software was around 1999 when I bought Quake for Linux, and I make my living as an engineer.  This idea of "mooching" makes no sense, and I find it extremely offensive to be quite honest with you.  There are thousands of people who work in IT fields donating their time to provide intellectually and commercially free software; Stallman did just talk about "intellectually free", he brought it into existence.   As to this idea of people clamoring for software and that being the downfall of Linux, I don't know what business you're in, but if you rely on servers, I can guarantee you that having a "pretty and easy to use" OS is not exactly at the top of your requirements list.  Granted, your comments are typical of people who switch from Windows and expect GNU/Linux to be a free version of it, but they are totally uninformed.</p>
<p>I have to say, you two utterly missed my point about the viability of fully free distros as well.  I and many users have been with the same distros for well over 15 years.  In my case, Slackware and Debian, which are roughly 20 years old and probably the two least commercial, mainstream distributions going.  This idea that Linux can't survive or be viable if it doesn't embrace Canonical's model is just ridiculous.  Ubuntu only got off of the ground because of Debian, and Ubuntu has yet to contribute back half as much as it has gotten.  You obviously don't get the difference between what the Linux kernel is and what the GNU OS is, despite the fact that I provided you links to educate yourself, so I feel like I'm wasting my breath here.  Hopefully the author of the article writes a follow up explaining what the Linux kernel, as well as contrasting it to GNU/OS and the FSF.</p>

<p>Yes- but Canonical is attempting to do that very thing which is something the hardcore linux enthusiasts don't understand or/and dont like. 
Linux will survive without Ubuntu, but it's not likely to become ^^^^ without them.</p>

      <blockquote>But to pretend that it is any realistic replacement for the PCs I use at work is absurd.

In the GIS field FOSS is well ahead of commercial products in many areas, especially in what concerns data and process available through the web. R is another good example of a product that simply sent the commercial competition back to where it came from. And I could go on...</p>

      <p>Yes this is late as I don't know what but please speak for yourself. I have been using nothing but Linux computers at work for the past 5 years or so.  On Unity some people will like it and other won't. It is what it is.   I don't. But the menu on top system of Gnome 2 (which you can easily change) is just fine and I've found it to work better than Windows for me. And quite a few Window users change their bar to show up on the top or side as well. Unit can be seen a progress because its pioneering new grounds... not because Gnome sucked.</p>
