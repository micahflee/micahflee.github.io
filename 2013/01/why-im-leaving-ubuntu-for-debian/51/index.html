      <p>Before I make this comment I will like to point out that I switched from Unity on Ubuntu to Crunchbang Linux, which is essentiall a tweaked openbox DE running on Debian and I am thus far happy with my decision. And I respect your decision for choosing Debian, I have a special place in my heart for Debian, they have kept it close to my philosophy for so long and (somewhat) continue to do so. I must say however that I can find an argument "for" ubuntu where you have argued "against"</p>
<p>Having said all that I can say that I agree with you on the Unity thing, but I would choose Unity of what Gnome has become any day.</p>
<p>About the paid for games on the ubuntu software center, I don't see how that violates the ubuntu philosophy - if anything it gives you an option for other software outside of the Ubuntu remit, albeit paid for. Yes they are advertising paid for software and you didn't ask for that, but they have to keep the Canonical electricity running I presume and that means paying bills and such, they need to figure out how to make money from a free product and aligned services, which is not easy at all especially if the primary audience of their product are not paying for the product (ref: Twitter - they are still trying to figure that out).</p>
<p>Also I don't see Ubuntu One being any different from the likes of Dropbox, or even google drive in terms of Lock in. Even ubuntu one daemon is open source while dropbox isn't... but I digress. Any form of cloud storage will require a daemon and client that you need to install on your computer (unless of course we're talking about box.net), there are clients for windows and os x i believe. Granted that you will always have to use Ubuntu one, but point me to any other cloud storage system that will not require you to use an API or bit of software that they don't provide themselves and does not constitute a lock in and I will go away and say no more.</p>
<p>To be honest, I can say for a fact that every time you connect to the internet, blog, or do anything social or share anything on the internet, you give up some privacy. That's not to say that I condone the blatant hawking of amazon stuff on the Dash. In fact I hate it because it slows down my computer that bit more.</p>
<p>In order to fix Bug #1 as you put it Canonical has to proliferate, in that getting onto as many platforms as possible is the way forward to compete with those guys so I see nothing wrong at all with attempting to unify their platforms, that's not to say that I will be rushing out to buy an ubuntu phone (although I would like to have one), but at least they are making a brilliant attempt in a very hostile environment.</p>
