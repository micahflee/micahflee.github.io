      <p>I have a slightly different take on this. Linux has never enjoyed mainstream appeal. As such you have hundreds of programs that never quite work as well as on windows because the developers either loose interest or they run out of money, or they know nothing about user interfaces. You have drivers that are hacked to work, games have to run through an emulator and then don't work all that well a lot of the time. The version of Photoshop I use for my business cannot function in Wine- the menu's are all screwed up and so its either turn to windows or run Gimp which I'm sorry to say is years behind. 
Along comes Ubuntu and for the first time people outside our little community are sitting up and taking note. 
Companies can now start porting over their good commercial software because the numbers are starting to look a little more inviting, and there is a place to sell it. That has attracted the attention of Valve, who are now porting their games to run natively on ubuntu, which could snowball. Yes Tux cart and Open arena are cool games, but come on, you cant compare those to Crysis and GTA. 
Most people need commercial software for their day to day activities because there just aren't any free alternatives. So the question is, would you rather dual boot into windows to run half your applications, or be able to run everything on linux?</p>
<p>As far as commercializing ubuntu, well they need to make money somehow. they can either keep it small and community driven and vanish into obscurity, or find some way to finance this machine.  If I'm buying through amazon, why not go through the dash and give them a bit of commission. And if I don't like being advertised to, then install a different lens.</p>
<p>Yes they are doing some things that people don't like, but the other distro's haven't really made much of a splash in the market in the last ten years and lets be honest they're not likely to in the next ten. Ubuntu is probably the only one that is really thinking HUGE. The more people start seeing Linux as a viable alternative, the quicker we will see proprietary drivers, better apps, games etc without having to give a penny to Microsoft. 
I will continue to support Ubuntu because I want to have a linux phone that docks into a linux os and can run the same programs. I want to see linux on my TV. I want to see the people that put hours of their time into developing these cool things in their spare time get the recognition they deserve and even make a decent wage out of doing what they enjoy, but I'm sorry to say, but that's not likely to happen anytime soon if Canonical closes their doors because no one else is thinking in that direction.</p>

      <p>Hear-Hear!!!</p>
<p>Well put, Peter.</p>
<p>I personally don't care whether every driver or bit of software if FLOSS. What Canonical are doing is realistic, &amp; relative to the real world, rather than being stuck in some autistic, hypocritical, Stallmanesque vacuum, where freedom only applies to software, unless of course one demands the recipe (source code) for the meal one orders in a restaurant, or the design &amp; manufacturing plans (source code) for the vehicle one uses for transport.</p>
<p>Yes, I too would like to have a computer in my pocket, one that is entirely compatible with all my other hardware, because it's the same operating system on all of them. Compare this to the absurd &amp; not necessarily software intercompatible number of versions of what is nominally the same version of M$W. What I would really like is a version of Ubuntu that could replace the utterly vile piece of Linux-based garbage known as Android to make a phone user-friendly.</p>
<p>Unity is something of a leap, &amp; as with the W8 interface, people resist change; but as a friend (&amp; a complete newcomer to *nix) who needed a new OS put on a Dell laptop with a broken version of W6 put it, "Wow!!! It (Ubuntu/Unity) is just like using a cellphone."</p>
<p>I'm glad Ubuntu is moving forward. The rest of Linuxland can stay on the fringes, arrogant in self-righteousness Ubuntu-bashing. I don't hear them raging against Android or ChromeOS or Red Hat.</p>
