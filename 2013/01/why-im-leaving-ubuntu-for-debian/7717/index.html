      <p>Selling software through Ubuntu isn't a bad idea. It might grind your gears because it's proprietary software, but there is nothing that's forcing you to buy/use this software. The general fact is that as developers we still need to make money, and not always does an opensource model work in this situation. For instance I'm creating a game framework, the game engine is opensource, but the editor is closed source. That's a great opensource business model, and pretty generic at that. However if you're selling a single piece of software, it's hard to opensource a fragment of it in some cases. Also Ubuntu One sells cloud storage because it costs money to host, this isn't preventing you from using dropbox or google drive as an alternative, however these services also charge for extra storage.</p>
<p>I'm assuming they're moving towards "apps" rather than programs because apps are more system specific and are typically based around a framework for that platform. This often makes security and integration much more simple for the developer and the end user alike. "App" isn't just a trendy word, it carries its own benefit. Where as a program to me is something like a Web Browser, Game, or something along those lines that's not necessarily interacting with component of your framework or really needs to conform to your UI. Components of an OS are programs, and apps are tools that add to the OS in an integrated manner. In a technical definition Apps are a software that directly help users perform tasks, whereas a computer program is simple a set of instructions that run on a computer. If that clarifies this seemingly gray area in computer science.</p>
<p>I don't think ubuntu is that bad. I'm not a big fan of Unity, because I like to see the grit of the machine and I'm not afraid of spending lots of time working with command line. However, ubuntu is making a great stride towards its goal, and though its been heavily scrutinized for being "bloated", "non-linux like", "too user friendly", "shiny", or what ever people are saying this month about it, it's been the most popular linux distro for a great number of reasons. Debian's packages are too often times way too outdated, and Ubuntu all together has more packages. Ubuntu is pre-configured, and as I've gotten older I've realized I don't have a week to fine tune my linux environment to have the coolest Conky script on the block.</p>
