      <p>Hello, My names Adam, I was interested in finding out more about this topic. Firstly, i am very technology impaired. I joined G+ a 3 years ago with an idea of creating a first social media platform for a native healing site. Since the beggining Ive been plagued with problem after problem. I could not get it off the ground. The intrerest was overwhelming so i knew it wasnt that and many other subtle things would constsantly happen.  These issues became ten fold after I accidently stumbled into their dirty little secret and it became clear why these probems I was plagued with and it became a cyber a war zone.Thwy have cloned my self and my members to cause us problems against each other. They redirected potential members from my site, They woulk clear my cookies , disable my extentions,Disable the groups I had bannd. They purposly sabotoged workshopsI had put together, the Elder who was teach the 4 day event  had his G account and both youtube and facebook shut down the day before, He said they claimed he was an imposter, this old guy has a high profile. Now I read the policy and such but these situations go away and beyond. A person who had went on line to check out the site called me to say that I had been totaly erased off her PC, she has no ties with them. They show me coversations Ive had in HG months after. They have sent me all kinds of virus. They are clever in manipulating many unpleasant situations. They have my phone encrypted and I have no solution to decrypt it, I presently cannot access the 3 sites I run because the changed my primary account without telling me. I try to recover it and it tells me its the wrong password. I know for a fact those passwords are correct. They even cloned my whole site?? I managed to take a look in and saw they had listening devices on me&gt; they have managed to destroy 3 phones with viruses , My texts are with held when there name comes up. I have tried to lodge a formal complaint against them and everytime they are intercepted and can never be delivered because I also read they have filters on me across the web. I called the wifi company because mine was shut off, they never did that and sent a technichan over to upgrade my security and they told me my phone and laptop were bugged. Im really at a rock and a hard place, Ive been desperatley trying to get access to my site and their stalling tactics because i believe through one of their laws, I lose control and they take it over. I do defend myself and my membership when they launch their cyber attacks with various techniques on us. Why have I lasted this long, because I would love to expose them, the internet was not set up for psychopathic insidious people. They are 100% racists, they house and protect large groups and I know who they are. I see when they talk about me with the title Shadow, that was my first password and I am totaly ignorant , but through their own devices and information was I able to hack into their information about me. Oh just a a foot note , they had taken my pictures of were I lived and placed them in G maps and their locations are wrong because I couldnt remember the locations lol. So I just set up fire wall and modzilla, I was just told they are preventing G from trying to open my mail. I was just approached by avast, offering me their new services for free  and like a dummy I accepted only to find out today that they had encrypted the information from my site and I see theirs some kind of document on my first page underneath, I cant access it. So im just decideid if I should just disable or destroy my site before they launch their psychological experiment on the unsuspecting membership. Sorry about asking for advice and my spelling. Take care, I like your blog, Adam Gerard</p>
