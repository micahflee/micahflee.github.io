      <p>Dear Micah Lee, I am not as smart as all you guys on this blog about all this technology, so please bare with me. I was hoping you can answer a question for me. I wanted to get a Faraday bag to shield me from radiation and electromagnetic fields. Yes, I am one of those crazy nuts who still worry about that. I understand that the Faraday bag would do that. But I had hoped that while my cell phone is in the F/bag, that my friends can still leave messages or texts, and then I can check them later. But from what I am reading on this blog, it doesn't sound like anyone would be able to get through and leave any kind of message. Am I right about that? Since you are much smarter than I on this topic, do you have any thoughts/suggestions? It would be very much appreciated!!</p>

      <p>That's right, faraday bags are designed to block wireless signals from penetrating the bag completely. People can still send you messages, they just won't reach the phone until after you take it out of the bag and it can talk to networks again. My advise to you is to not worry about the radiation emitted by your cell phone. It's non-ionizing and isn't harmful to health. Also, your phone's radio transmitters are not very powerful compared to the transmitters on cell phone towers, FM radio towers, etc., and those signals are constantly going through your body, but that doesn't matter either because they aren't harmful to your health.</p>
<p>If you really want to protect your body from harmful radiation, you should wear sunscreen.</p>

      <p>Can I ask another dumb question? So then are you saying that let's say I am carrying around my phone in a faraday bag in my purse and a friend is trying to send me a text (or call me) during that time. Does that text (or voice mail message) get completely lost, or does it just "wait" in limbo (so to speak) until I take my phone out of the faraday bag, and then that text (or voicemail message) reaches my phone and gets registered (for lack of a better word) and ultimately gets sent to my phone, and I still receive that text (or voicemail message), but just after I take my phone out of the faraday bag? Is that how it works? Or is it that this friend would not be able to reach my phone at all while in the faraday bag? Thanks for your patience with my questions.</p>

      <p>When your friend sends you a SMS message, they actually send it to your cell phone carrier, who collects a queue of messages to deliver to you. Your carrier will try to deliver it immediately, but if your handset isn't on the network, it will wait until it appears on the network before sending it. So if your phone is turned off (or if it's in a faraday bag), your messages will just queue up on your carrier's computer all until it connects to the network again, and your carrier will then send them all at once.</p>
<p>So just by putting your phone in a faraday bag (or turning it off) shouldn't make you lose any messages.</p>

      <p>With all due respect to your posting, and IMHO, you wouldn't have a need for a Faraday bag if you are truly worried about harmful UV rays, and if you are talking about body scanners, x-rays and the like, a Faraday bag is just enough to fit a mobile phone, and maybe a tablet. The idea that a Faraday will protect your body seems impractical because there are other more plausible ways of protecting yourself from harmful rays.  But if I continue, i will digress from the topic so best  to stop here.</p>
<p>Going back to your condition that your mobile, while inside a Faraday must be able to receive messages, and or certain alerts you have chosen; this only means that a Faraday is not what you need because  a good quality Faraday will prevent any type of radio connections or radio signals from bluetooth, WiFi, mobile connection, all sensors, NFC, GPS,  from entering or going out of the bag.  But there is a caveat here:  A Faraday CANNOT stop sounds from leaving the bag, or entering the bag.  Putting a mobile inside a true working Faraday is not really a foolproof way of avoiding hackers if your phone is the target.  So depending on your needs and situation you're supposed to use it for.</p>
<p>Frankly, a Faraday, in order to be a feasible product, is being marketed as an indispensable tool to secure our privacy, and that we need to use this always.  It is as a matter of fact,  impractical and inconvenient if we follow the directions on the numerous ways described on the tin that a Faraday can secure our privacy.  Hilarious actually because it says it secures our data from leaving the bag because it disallows any type connection.  This is true but once your mobile is out of the bag, there goes your data leaving your device at the first connection it can get, and since your phone is marked to targeted, it doesn't even matter if a malware has been installed prior because there are other ways of getting to your data before it leaves your phone.</p>
<p>A Faraday has as its best use, for preventing hackers from penetrating your phone from another device nearby, whether android or not.  Say, you're Video chatting on your tablet, and your mobile is nearby.  A   hacker can, without your noticing it as your busy doing work or video chatting on your tablet,  enable your bluetooth to discover other devices in your room, your Samsung TV,  then can see you also from TVcam.  Then hacker via tablet bluetooth discovers your phone and if the hacker is a malicious one, can scare by sending you a message on your phone.  You get scared reading the message when you realize the hacker has you covered, He threatens you and tells what you're doing because he can still see you or maybe not. You close the app and even uninstall it because that's the best way to rid of the hacker. You wonder how  hacker got your mobile number and how was he able to send you a text ?  You factory reset the phone right away.</p>
<p>A Faraday can block signals from reaching the mobile inside.   When Video chatting with strangers using a tablet, make sure all devices, phone, other tablets and devices nearby have their airplane mode on.  Use a VPN app to prevent hacker from discovering other devices nearby.   And don't buy a Samsung TV  ;-)</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
