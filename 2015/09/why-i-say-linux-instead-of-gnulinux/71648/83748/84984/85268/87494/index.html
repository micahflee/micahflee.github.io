<p>Hello again,
I believe you are confused in some sense. You continue referring to the entire GNU operating system with the Linux kernel as "Linux", even though this is clearly erroneous. In addition to that, it is also unfair; you should give equal consideration to the GNU Project, which contributed as much (if not more) to the GNU/Linux system than the kernel. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system.
You can read my writings on the subject either at <a href="https://stallman.org">https://stallman.org</a> or <a href="https://gnu.org">https://gnu.org</a>, and this article may be of particular interest to you: <a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/why-gnu-linux.en.html">https://www.gnu.org/gnu/why-gnu-linux.en.html</a></p>
<h2 id="i-got-a-reply-dennis-a.-gutowski-said:">I got a reply! Dennis A. Gutowski said:</h2><p>Is the gnu contribution important? Yes. But just as equally, if not more so, is
the kernel. This operating system never was, nor will ever be gnu. It’s Linux.
Why? Because all those wonderful programs you wrote do literally nothing without
the kernel. They are entirely useless without it.</p>
<p>If you write and release a gnu kernel, and I reference it, I promise you I will
refer to it as gnu. But OS’s like Ubuntu are and will always be Linux.</p>

<p>Hello Dennis,
Of course the Kernel is an important part of the operating system - necessary,
even.  But in order to meaningfully interact with a Kernel you need userland
tools, such as those developed by GNU.  It's as you say, the GNU system is not
functional without a Kernel -- but so too is the Kernel "entirely useless"
without GNU.  You can see there is a mutual dependence on the Kernel and GNU,
they both need each other.  The Kernel does everything behind the scenes -- you
don't interact with the Kernel, you interact with GNU.  You could say the most
meaningful interactions you have with your computer are the interactions you
make with GNU, not the Kernel.  This is why both GNU and the Kernel deserve
equal credit -- GNU+Linux.  By omitting "GNU" from "GNU+Linux", you are saying
the contributions to GNU are so meaningless as to not even warrant a mention.</p>
<p>There is a GNU Kernel, it is called Hurd -- you can learn more about it here:
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/">https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/</a></p>
<p>Ubuntu is not an "OS" on it's own, it's a flavor (or distribution) of GNU+Linux
built upon the distribution Debian. Ubuntu adds nonfree blobs and used to even
add spyware, you can read about that here:
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/ubuntu-spyware.en.html">https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/ubuntu-spyware.en.html</a>
Nonetheless, Ubuntu is not "Linux".  Ubuntu is not a Kernel, nor is it shipped
without GNU userland.  Ubuntu depends on GNU just as it depends on the Kernel.
As you can see, it is more proper to refer to Ubuntu as "Ubuntu GNU+Linux",
rather than simply "Linux".</p>
<p>rms</p>
<p>Oliver,
Notepad and Minesweeper are not "core applications" that are required to 
interact in any meaningful way with the Kernel. It is a false equivalency.  Of 
course it's entirely possible to use Windows without Notepad, but it is much 
more difficult, if at all possible, to interact with a Linux system lacking 
core 
utilities.  You cannot exactly admin a server without being able to use chmod,
rm, echo, or many of the other coreutils.</p>
<p>You also seem to equate GNU in it's entirety with GNU Coreutils alone, which is 
also a mistake. GNU is much more than the few dozen utilities included in GNU 
Coreutils.  GNU also includes many libraries the Kernel -- and most userland 
applications you come across -- depends on, including GNU's implementation of 
libc, not to mention the fact that Linux is compiled solely with the GNU C 
Compiler.  Even without any GNU Coreutils, your Linux distribution still 
depends on GNU in many ways you may not see.</p>
<p>This is not simply a matter of language evolving, it's more a matter of 
exposure and acknowledgement. GNU has contributed massively to the community -- 
it might not even exist in it's current state if it weren't for GNU. To simply 
omit GNU from the discussion by calling it "Linux" alone is damaging not only 
to GNU, but also to newcomers who may not otherwise hear about GNU or it's 
importance. It's really not that much work to acknowledge GNU in this case -- 
it's 4 extra keystrokes, and it will benefit everybody.</p>
