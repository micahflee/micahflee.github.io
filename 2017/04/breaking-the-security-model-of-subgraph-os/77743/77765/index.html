      <p>This is super long, so I'll just respond with a few points:</p>
<ul>
<li>You say that both Subgraph OS and Qubes are alpha software. But this is wrong. SGOS is alpha, but Qubes has been stable for years.</li>
<li>The system requirements for Qubes 4.x includes new CPU features because these features will make relying on Xen more secure. One of the main reasons I'm looking forward to 4.x is because it will mean that most Xen VM escape bugs will no longer have any affect on Qubes.</li>
<li>You seem confused about the security benefits of reproducible builds. Reproducibility can protect you from from malicious software vendors, and can protect software vendors from attackers who hack them/steal their signing keys. It doesn't make your OS more secure though. Still, it's a worthy goal. See <a href="https://www.qubes-os.org/news/2016/05/30/build-security/" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/816" rel="nofollow">here</a> for more info.</li>
<li>The "feel like a God" thing was a joke I <a href="https://twitter.com/micahflee/status/577998730340622337" rel="nofollow">tweeted</a>.</li>
</ul>

      <p>No, I didn't say that. I said Qubes' <em>security model</em> -- and not Qubes itself -- is and will remain as alpha as any other (not even better than plain Debian), as long as builds are not reproducible. And I'm not confusing why we need these, either.</p>
<p>Indeed I went at length in my two comments above, that was a long effort of mine, for your benefit, so you understand precisely what I'm saying. But I guess I wasted my time, since you're even misquoting me and took it all wrong.</p>
<p>Today we have 0% certainty in the integrity of any OS installed on any machine beyond installation time, because from the moment we accept just one update downloaded over the internetz, it's all down to a single OpenPGP signature. That impacts Qubes, just the same as any other OS. As long as I respect Qubes devs, I don't believe they have superpowers and can guarantee noone else obtained a copy of that key. If you read them carefully, you'll see they don't claim that, either. Distributing a whole malicious ISO would be spotted way too fast, so I guess we're right to trust these. But single package updates are an entire different things, even over Tor (which I use also with apt on Debian by the way, for long already). Not to mention past or future privilege escalations, etc. If you ignore that, you have a false sense of security.</p>
<p>By the way, I've read this Qubes ticket you're pointing long ago, because once it will be reproducible (and Fedora is stripped out of dom0) then I'll be interested in Qubes as well as in SubGraph: then, and only then, I'll feel like the overhead is worth the sacrifice. But in your links, there's (still) nothing much on this topic, what you should read instead is that thread (sorry, I thought I had provided it above, and you should read all my other links too):</p>
<p><a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/qubes-devel/gq-wb9wTQV8/mdliS4P2BQAJ">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/qubes-devel/gq-wb9wTQV8/mdliS4P2BQAJ</a></p>
<p>(eventually, you'll also gain a more relative opinion on how young Qubes still is under the hood, just reading the thread's last comment -- and its date. Again it's pretty normal, any OS needs years and years to mature)</p>
<p>Finally, as I tried to explain also, of course new architectures do bring new security features, but also evil things like "secure enclaves" and other bits which, as long as we don't have stateless hardware, bring more dangers than benefits -- I believe. So did e.g. Johanna and others, read them or even ask them if you don't believe me, since you're in touch with them. You'll see that at least I have read them at length and with much attention.</p>
<p>Enjoy Easter holiday! :)</p>
