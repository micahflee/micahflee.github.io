      <p>TL;DR: I hope that'll be clearer re:cooloutac, I'm certainly not trolling about [put your favourite distros here] and I'm praising Qubes people and choices overall as well (if hardware resources will permit). But from my point of view, Qubes OS' approach for a "security model", as a whole, is just as alpha as any other, due to much deeper issues which it addressed (so far) no better than any other except Debian community (which SubGraph is part of).</p>
<p>Micah's claim to have "exploited" SubGraph security model here is, in my view, a little bold or short-sighted (at best). As he wrote himself, it also affects any Nautilus user on any traditional distro. So where's that top-emergency CVE the whole world should hold their breath for, until it's patched and deployed, while it would make GNU/Linux "no better than windows"? Nowhere, thanks for the humour. It's like watching two little babes (here, Qubes and SubGraph), new born and still fighting hard to stabilize their heartbeats, praising one and pointing out how ugly is the other's haircut.</p>
<p>For those who can't seem to get that point, pretty basic I would have thought, I (personally) avoid to use any "alpha" software anywhere outside of a fully isolated VM, and therefore neither use, nor would recommend SubGraph or Qubes to anyone being at risk, for the time being. Also, SubGraph people's reaction is pretty sane, I reckon: they've got lots to do anyway, including plenty of things each a lot more serious than this one -- yes, really -- again it's alpha, still it's a gentle contribution (and publicity nevertheless), they publicly tweet Micah's blog post without any shame, help him bootstrap his new security-expert career. Thunder!</p>
<p>Re: Debian vs. Fedora/RedHat (and their kernel development indeed), I was talking about the desperate need for reproducible builds in order to regain trust in any OS directly in charge of hardware. Because at the core, deployment of software generally, and worse security patches, is poetry (if you doubt, read the latest QSB, link below, from Google Zero to Xen's embargo story).</p>
<p>Currently, your entire trust chain lies with the OS -- in Qubes, that's dom0 -- verifying OpenPGP package signatures to update all components including itself, Xen and/or any other core security bits above or below, which your entire "security by isolation" depends on, as well as all your domains.</p>
<p>Meet rpm and base system from Fedora which, as Qubes devs state in their own docs, is software they "more or less blindly trust". Not blaming anyone: how could they do better anyway? They acknowledged the need for reproducible builds (starting of course, with dom0), but they're bound to Fedora's (complete lack of) interest in the matter. Anyway, they even put in writing their intention to rebase dom0 to something else than Fedora, much lighter they wish (but only after GUI domain will be migrated from KDE in dom0, to Gnome in its own GUI domain, if I recall correctly).</p>
<p>I'm not sure about the current status of the decision on the future of dom0 OS (I searched), but (1) Yes, dom0 is "technically offline", still (2) Yes, it fetches and upgrades itself the traditional OpenPGP way "from the Internetz", even if it organizes these network interactions "indirectly via another domain" and filters what it fetches that way (3) Yes, it still presides your entire system's destiny, including that of Xen and (4) Yes, therefore it matters a lot what OS runs in dom0, it is not only "Xen".</p>
<p>On the hardware side, reading R4 requirements one may notice Qubes authors' attempt to pressure manufacturers a bit, once again, towards the design of stateless systems. They have done more than their part e.g. also ringing the bell about IME, TPM in the past, or so-called "secure enclaves" in more recent CPUs. So forcing Qubes users to adopt these architectures from R4, appears to me as some contradiction. Market pressure, security balance? Is "ze big firmware mess" at least equally bad as "secure enclaves" anyway? May other new architecture features bring "something" positive in such a mess, "somewhat" bending the banza√Ø towards the other edge of the pot? Is it an absolute necessity to keep installing Qubes on brand new hardware? I guess Qubes answered "Yes" to all three questions, hence their move.</p>
<p>Exactly for these reasons, I moved back to Debian ecosystem few years ago: contrary to you, Micah, it takes me a lot more than "a few days" to (re)learn one, I much value long-term support to not-so-recent hardware, and I'm looking forward to SubGraph and Tails becoming not only safe enough to my criterias, but Debian Pure Blends one nice day, I hope.</p>
<p>Last, whatever I use I doubt I'll ever "feel like God" using it -- seriously Micah, you might want to spread more humility^W caution on Qubes website's testimonies :) That's exactly the kind of false sense of security we all try to educate everyone to stay away from, therefore it should work as a counter-productive advert for Qubes, I feel like they deserve better.</p>

      <p>This is super long, so I'll just respond with a few points:</p>
<ul>
<li>You say that both Subgraph OS and Qubes are alpha software. But this is wrong. SGOS is alpha, but Qubes has been stable for years.</li>
<li>The system requirements for Qubes 4.x includes new CPU features because these features will make relying on Xen more secure. One of the main reasons I'm looking forward to 4.x is because it will mean that most Xen VM escape bugs will no longer have any affect on Qubes.</li>
<li>You seem confused about the security benefits of reproducible builds. Reproducibility can protect you from from malicious software vendors, and can protect software vendors from attackers who hack them/steal their signing keys. It doesn't make your OS more secure though. Still, it's a worthy goal. See <a href="https://www.qubes-os.org/news/2016/05/30/build-security/" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/816" rel="nofollow">here</a> for more info.</li>
<li>The "feel like a God" thing was a joke I <a href="https://twitter.com/micahflee/status/577998730340622337" rel="nofollow">tweeted</a>.</li>

      <p>No, I didn't say that. I said Qubes' <em>security model</em> -- and not Qubes itself -- is and will remain as alpha as any other (not even better than plain Debian), as long as builds are not reproducible. And I'm not confusing why we need these, either.</p>
<p>Indeed I went at length in my two comments above, that was a long effort of mine, for your benefit, so you understand precisely what I'm saying. But I guess I wasted my time, since you're even misquoting me and took it all wrong.</p>
<p>Today we have 0% certainty in the integrity of any OS installed on any machine beyond installation time, because from the moment we accept just one update downloaded over the internetz, it's all down to a single OpenPGP signature. That impacts Qubes, just the same as any other OS. As long as I respect Qubes devs, I don't believe they have superpowers and can guarantee noone else obtained a copy of that key. If you read them carefully, you'll see they don't claim that, either. Distributing a whole malicious ISO would be spotted way too fast, so I guess we're right to trust these. But single package updates are an entire different things, even over Tor (which I use also with apt on Debian by the way, for long already). Not to mention past or future privilege escalations, etc. If you ignore that, you have a false sense of security.</p>
<p>By the way, I've read this Qubes ticket you're pointing long ago, because once it will be reproducible (and Fedora is stripped out of dom0) then I'll be interested in Qubes as well as in SubGraph: then, and only then, I'll feel like the overhead is worth the sacrifice. But in your links, there's (still) nothing much on this topic, what you should read instead is that thread (sorry, I thought I had provided it above, and you should read all my other links too):</p>
<p><a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/qubes-devel/gq-wb9wTQV8/mdliS4P2BQAJ">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/qubes-devel/gq-wb9wTQV8/mdliS4P2BQAJ</a></p>
<p>(eventually, you'll also gain a more relative opinion on how young Qubes still is under the hood, just reading the thread's last comment -- and its date. Again it's pretty normal, any OS needs years and years to mature)</p>
<p>Finally, as I tried to explain also, of course new architectures do bring new security features, but also evil things like "secure enclaves" and other bits which, as long as we don't have stateless hardware, bring more dangers than benefits -- I believe. So did e.g. Johanna and others, read them or even ask them if you don't believe me, since you're in touch with them. You'll see that at least I have read them at length and with much attention.</p>
<p>Enjoy Easter holiday! :)</p>
